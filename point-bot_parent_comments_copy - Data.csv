googlesheets,Why does my chart start in the negative?,"https://preview.redd.it/nsms3qdhcv7e1.png?width=1960&format=png&auto=webp&s=49a91adedcc325c9a4d5e66830e4210b04038181

Here is an image of the table I'm using for my chart. I am referencing a different data set on a separate tab for these numbers.

The Total column is using this formula: =SUMIFS('2024 Project Data Source Sheet'!F:F, '2024 Project Data Source Sheet'!E:E, A4)

The internal column is using this: =SUMIFS('2024 Project Data Source Sheet'!F:F, '2024 Project Data Source Sheet'!D:D, ""Internal"", '2024 Project Data Source Sheet'!E:E, A4)

* in this one, I am wondering if it is because I quote ""Internal"" instead of a cell?

External column is a simple: =minus(B4, C4)

I can't figure out why my data is starting at -144:00:00

I never took a course in any spreadsheet. I just started to learn by practice yesterday.

Edit:

Something is wrong with these three cells. Once removed, the chart updates correctly

The chart shouldn't change in appearance except that along the X-axis it will say 24 instead of 24:00:00.

Remember; converting to hours as integers isn't 'losing' minutes; it's just showing an hour and half as 1.5 instead of 01:30:00.

googlesheets,How do I change many similar formulas to a single MAP-type formula to keep a running count of dates that resets the count when the year of the date changes.,"So I keep track of movies that I watch in a sheet. Every movie gets a single row with about ten columns worth of data per movie (title, release year, genre, etc.). Almost all of that data is irrelevant to this problem.

\-

In one column, I keep a running count of the Grand Total of entries into the sheet. So the first movie I watched and wrote down has a 1 in that column. The movie I watched yesterday has a 4,367 in that column. This is easy and is a single BYROW formula.

Next to that I want a yearly count. So the first movie with a watch date of 2023 has a 1 in that column; the last movie with a watch date of 2023 has, in my case, has a 420 (blaze it); while the very next entry would have a 1 (because it would be the first movie with a watched date of 2024).

This is where my issue comes up.

Previously, I was doing this with a formula in each cell. This is easy; check to see if the year of the previous entry is the same year as the current entry -  +1 if it's the same, set to 1 if different. I want to change these 1000s of formulas to a single formula. I feel MAP() is the way to go here.

Here's a [link to a test version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pZh-FXqh1Ct6Fln3B6vCeUUmSFEt4h37RVpXHg1wpTE/edit?usp=sharing) of what I'm working with.

I've tried to just convert the ""1000s of formula"" version into a Map version (all the other times I've converted to a BYROW type formula this has worked). 

`=MAP(D2:D16,D3:D17, LAMBDA(PREV,CURR, IF(YEAR(PREV)=YEAR(CURR), C2+1,1)))`

This doesn't work. It seems that the C2+1 doesn't advance with each step down. Since the IF statement becomes TRUE for the second time through, it's trying to do C2+1 when it should be C3+1 at that point. To combat this, I tried to add it to the MAP part with...

`=MAP(E2:E16,E3:E17,C2:C16, LAMBDA(PREV,CURR,YCOUNT, IF(YEAR(PREV)=YEAR(CURR), YCOUNT+1,1)))`

This doesn't work. It seems that it takes all of C2:C16 in at once (not surprising), so it's giving a Circular Dependency error.

Does anyone have some insight into this? Thank you!",12/18/24 16:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1hheaui/how_do_i_change_many_similar_formulas_to_a_single/,Chrispy52x2006,"    =SCAN(1,D3:D,LAMBDA(x,y,IF(isblank(y),,IF(year(y)=year(offset(y,-1,0)),x+1,1))))

googlesheets,What formula do I use to consolidate the multiple IF AND formulas I’ve used? ,"I needed to calculate M&H and G&A depending on whether colD said “BP, OP1, OP2…” AND whether col i said “sub, prime” and due to needing to have this ready for a meeting today i just did a bunch of “if(AND))” formulas to reference the correct cells. 

So i currently have= IF(and(D=“BP”, I=“prime”), $J12*$I$5,””) for example and depending on which contract period it is, the M&H/G&A rates will change so i created the IFAND formula for each contract period depending on whether it’s a prime or a sub and the formula is huge.

googlesheets,G Sheets to Excel transition - dynamic dropdowns,"I have a workbook that I want to create in Google Sheets and then download into Excel (for work compliance reasons). The problem is that when the user opens the xls, they get a bunch of error messages because the formulas aren't readable.  More importantly, this prevents them from previewing the files in Outlook.

The formulas that cause issues are FILTER and UNIQUE.  It's strange, because my version of Excel has both of those formulas (and they work exactly the same way), so I don't know why they would be unreadable.  The UNIQUE isn't a big deal; I can figure out a way around that.  But the FILTER is necessary for the 2 dynamic dropdowns that the workbook has (making a list based on one dropdown, using that list as the basis for a new dropdown, then using **that** as the basis for yet a third dropdown).  

So I have 3 questions: 

1. Are there versions of FILTER that would work smoothly in both G Sheets and Excel (and won't cause problems when converted)?  I've tried a few that I found online, but they didn't work.

2. Are there any tricks for converting to Excel that preserve the formulas or at least don't cause error messages?

3. If the answer to both of those is ""no"", is there a script that would copy the formulas into static values, download to Excel, then change them back into formulas?

I'm using a sheet to track my reading, with columns for content type (ebook, audiobook, physical book), book title, pages read, and a rating for that reading session.

googlesheets,How do i get sum of values of a merged row,"Yeah well, sheet 1 is an inventory movement list. So im trying to keep things neat since it would be used daily. Basically my aim is to get the total balance of the individual items via pivot table or at least some sort of summary table in another sheet. 

I am aware that you would need to have cells unmerged for analysis to be done. But was hoping to find a way such that either 

1)when adding new row into coffee and merging it at column B will allow the product code to automatically bring down into the new row in column A so that pivot table can summarise the data.
So that column A can be hidden and there is no need to manually key/drag down when new row is added

Or 

2) somehow still have column B neat (not too much repetition) but can have the total values.

Edit 
Thinking it through, if i used an if statement formula in column a so that if something is detected in column C, column A will return with the product code. But i will need a way so that it will autofill with the correct product code and i have no idea to do that.

Here's an example:

Done.  Delete all the boxes; put this into cell B5.  Also, just change Sept to Sep to conform to the date standard in sheets; and it will populate all those cells automatically.  Then next year you only have to change the year in that top cell to 2025 and it will all change.

Edit:

I put it on a test sheet.  See link:

Those indirects() are still hurting but if you want to dynamically reference a sheet by name you're kind of stuck with them.  You could still avoid hardcoding the column numbers but it would be sort of artificial and hurt readability.

\- I hadn't looked at that page before, but I note there are 10,000 rows there of which only 2700 are used.  So between the 5 columns that's around 35K formulas that aren't doing anything.

\- You are using iterative calculations to save ""Time entered"". Idk if this has any negative performance hit (other than a small one to that specific column).  But I'd at least set the max iterations to 1.

\- In your first equation subRange is calculated via indirect even when it's not used. So 10K times everytime something changes.

\-----

To get rid of the extra 7300 extra calculations, you could use map() formula and pre-filter your ranges so you don't have to check for blanks 7300 times either.

map() would also allow you to precaculate some things once per column where applicable, e.g. the vstacks in your second formula, rather than 2700 times.

Using that formula as an example:

    =let(lookupR, vstack('Rev sheets'!$C$5:$C,'Rev sheets'!$H$5:$H),
         resultR, vstack('Rev sheets'!$D$5:$D,'Rev sheets'!$I$5:$I),
         z,counta(A:A)-1,
         map(offset(A1,1,0,z),offset(I1,1,0,z), 
         lambda(    id,              response, 
         XLOOKUP(id, lookupR, resultR, response, 0, -1))))

vstacks are done before map, so only once for the whole column.

Column A is used as a column that always has a value if it's a valid data row, so we can use counta() on it to determine how many rows have been imported. I count the rows and subtract 1 for use in the offset formulas.

offset formulas build a range like I2:I2700 or whatever, i.e. exactly the number of rows that are valid.

I put the goofy extra blanks in the lambda() row to line up the variables with the ranges, so see that ID corresponds to column A, and response to column I.

(I'm not happy about this whole technique... sheets really needs a way to instantly return a range capped to the last row of data in the sheet.)

map() takes those ranges, and calls the lambda function one row at a time, passing the current cell in the ranges in as id and response, similar to let.

So... this one formula takes the place of 10,000, and we are only creating 2700 rows of calculations by prefiltering the ranges.

\---

Side note: I see that ""Rev sheets"" has 10K rows.  So your vstacks are making 20K entry arrays, which then are used 2700 times in XLOOKUP, and half the time or so it has to scan through 10K mostly blank entries before finding a match.

You could do some finagling to carefully trim those down as part of the vstack (ensuring lookupR and resultR stay aligned), or... simpler... just get rid of those extra rows in ""Rev sheets"" if they aren't needed.

In general, getting rid of extra rows and columns is a good idea.

googlesheets,Decimal numbers not matching (to the 12th decimal),"Hello there! Here is my problem:  
  
\> I have a number in B1 and in C1, they both come from another formula that I don't think is useful to know about.

\> Then, in B2 and C2, I wrote the same numbers (with the same 15 decimals).

\> In the third row, respectively B3 and C3, I verify that the numbers in each columns are the same, with a IF() formula. If it's corresponding, the IF() says 1, if not it says 0. So I know for sure that each numbers are the same, thanks to the IF() verification.

BUT when I try to calculate B1-C1, the result is not the same as when I calculate B2-C2. There is a 0,000000001 difference.

How is that possible ? :O

I already verified the format between all the cells, and changed it so it is the same.

I add below a first screen with what I see in ""classical"" view. And a second one with the ""formula"" view.

Give the tables meaningful names, i.e. the same as the account, and use Table References to refer to them.

In general the fewer data tables the better.  So at a minimum, don't create separate tables for each month.   Keep all the AMEX transactions in one table, etc., and use Table view / filters as desired when working with that account, if you want to see only the transactions for that month.

Create a Dropdowns tab where you set up values used in dropdown lists, i.e. Category. Then for the dropdown in each account (and on the main sheet, see below) use ""Dropdown (from a range)"" rather than entering a list directly.  This ensures the list consistent wherever it's used, and modifications made will be reflected everywhere (except not for color coding unfortunately).

On your main sheet, use a filter() function with criteria you set up.  vstack() your tables together before performing the filter.

I duplicated it and made the changes here -- [Forum Help - Shared Sheet for Help... - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q9CvgjwDXIyFDyFOsOKcd6XMjnBR_JArYa3J_sVlw3s/edit?gid=421915487#gid=421915487)

If you're new to Sheets, hopefully this won't be overwhelming. Sorry if I break it down too much, but I'd rather over-explain something you already know, than not explain something well enough, and have you be in the dark. If you're unsure of anything, please just ask; I don't mind explaining something in more detail or in a different way.

First, I created an ""Employees"" tab, for all the Employee names, so they'll all be accessible as drop-down boxes in the other tabs. I used ""data validation"" -> ""dropdown from range"", then selected ""$A$2:$A"" as the range for the other tabs. The neat thing about this, is as you add or delete names to that sheet, they'll automatically be added to or deleted from the drop-down boxes in the other sheets. It also keeps you from accidentally mistyping someone's name, which is extremely important, since the function you'll use matches the Employee names on one sheet to another sheet. 

On the ""Weekly Schedule"" tab, I filled in tomorrow's date in G4, to the right of ""Week of"", then referenced that cell for the other dates below it and also in the other tabs, so that cell will be the only date you'll change. I ""froze"" the rows at Row 6, so as you scroll down, you'll still be able to see things like what day it is. \[I also added a bit of data to some schedules, just to check the formula I used, to make sure it's working properly, but that didn't change anything in a material way.\]

Instead of a single ""daily"" tab, I duplicated the tabs to have one for each working day of the week; it would be easy enough to have a single tab, and then have each day in its own set of rows or columns, but I wasn't sure how you wanted it. Each of these tabs will be basically the same; I'll explain what I did using Monday as an example.

First, I added the date at the top, so it's easy to see which day is which (and I referenced the date on the Weekly Schedule, so this will automatically update whenever you change the date for ""Week of""). I used Data Validation -> ""Dropdown from Range"" like I mentioned above, to fill in the Employee Names. The only other thing I changed was to input a formula using VLOOKUP to automatically fill in the ""shift"" when an employee's name is entered in the Daily Schedule. I'll use the first one (Cell C4) as an example:

=ifna(VLOOKUP(B4,'Weekly Schedule'!$B$7:$I$50,3,FALSE),"""")

To break this down, ignore ""ifna"" for now, and just start with VLOOKUP. Basically, this is telling the spreadsheet, ""match up the employee name in Cell B4 to the first column of this named range (here it's Col B of the ""Weekly Schedule"" tab), then look in the rest of the range (here it's from B7 to i50) and return the result in the 3rd column of that range for the employee name"". I picked the 3rd column because Monday is in the third column of the range. The ""false"" makes it look for an exact match, otherwise it will just return whatever is the closest. I wrapped the VLOOKUP in ""ifna"" at the beginning with empty quotes at the end (""""), so that if there is no employee name, the cell will simply be empty. \[If I didn't do that, it would return ""#N/A"" in each empty cell.\]

The formula is basically the same in all the rest of the tabs, except the column number before ""FALSE"" changes from 3 to 4, and so on to ""8"", which is Saturday's column.

With this setup, on the Weekly Schedule tab, you'll input Sunday's date in the cell next to ""Week Of:"", and add shifts to each day and employee as necessary. Then on the tabs for each day, you'll assign the employees to their assigned spots (Register #, Dept, etc.), and the daily shifts will automatically update.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1hemq6x/using_table_to_fill_out_schedule/m2a3xao/,OutrageousYak5868,1,"`=ifna(VLOOKUP(B4,'Weekly Schedule'!$B$7:$I$50,3,FALSE),"""")","`=ifna(VLOOKUP(B4,'Weekly Schedule'!$B$7:$I$50,3,FALSE),"""")",,,,,
googlesheets,How to sum only values in a range when their associated cell is not a certain string?,"Hi all, hopefully my title isn't too confusing but I've got a problem with a complicated formula that I'm trying to fix. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m9aru7mvWUuH-Kjq28_pPwlgbEm5DgN808e-DxtT-lM/edit?usp=sharing) is an example copy of more or less what I'm working with here, and this is the problem formula I'm trying to fix:

The problem is the second part of the IFS function. In this example the formula is in B3; I want it to look at the cell above it (B2) and if said cell contains the string ""EE"" (in this case it does,) then for the formula to sum together everything in the range B3:F3 that *doesn't* have ""EE"" in the cell above it in row 2, then subtract that sum from I2 and return that as B3's value. Unfortunately it's not doing that at all. It's just returning the value of I2. I assume it's just not summing anything at all so what it's returning is just I2-0, but I have no idea how to make it correctly sum that B3:F3 range while excluding anything that has ""EE"" above it. I've included some other example data in the sheet to show that all the rest of the formula is working correctly, it's just that second part. How do I fix this?

googlesheets,How to count the # of rows that have cells with certain criteria?,"Hello,

Im a student and currently trying to make a grad plan using sheets to know what classes I have done and the info related to the classes (level/year, subject, credits, final grade etc..) and the criteria i need to graduate (# of minimum lower and upper level credits, certain # of credits in my field etc..).

Im trying to create a system using formulas to automatically scan for certain criteria and update my graduate plan. For example: 

I need at least 33 upper level (level 3000 or 4000) credits in my related field (Psychology). In my spreadsheet i have the classes organized into rows, with each column dedicated to different info about the class - from left to right: class Name, ID, year/level, subject, attributes, and credits. 

What I’m wanting to do is have a formula that can scan each row and look for certain criteria - in this case any classes that are level 3000 or 4000 and have the subject Psychology, and then sum the # of associated credits with each class that fits that criteria. (Hope that makes sense)

googlesheets,Help Copying Conditional Formatting Date Cells Based on How Far in the Past,"I have found several questions in this sub and elsewhere on the web that are similar to mine, but not quite the same, and while they got me this far, the solutions offered in those answers isn't working for my current problem. 

I am trying to make a recurring task tracker sheet. One column is for ""date last completed."" I set up conditional formatting so that if the date in a cell is within a week, two weeks, three, four, and five weeks, the cell color will change (green, yellow, orange, red, dark red). It works in the cell I set up, but when I try to copy the formatting to other cells in the column, the conditional formatting does not update the reference cell. 

Example: 

=TODAY() - C2 <=6 makes the cell green

=TODAY() - C2 <=14 makes the cell yellow and so on. 

That works great for the date in C2. But when I use ""paste-special formatting only"" to the rest of the cells in the column or use the formula paint feature, Google Sheets does not change C2 in the custom formula to C3, C4, etc. It just applies the conditional formatting to the full range of the column, only paying attention to the value in C2. I hope that makes sense. 

Is there a way for me to copy the conditional formatting to the rest of the cells in column C, but have the custom formula automatically update the row the conditional formatting is comparing against? Am I writing the custom formula wrong to do what I want? 

I really can't deal with having to manually create five custom formatting rules for each cell in the column. 

I've added a link to my template in comment mode; I hope that makes the conditional formatting viewable. I have also added a sceenshot below.

googlesheets,Listing only values greater than zero? Building a stock porfolio tracker,"I need help to build part of my stock portfolio tracker. Ideally it would build a dashboard of current assets and performance based on a list of transactions.

It may be a bit trickier than the title suggest... I have a list of transactions - buy and sell orders - for different brokerage accounts. I'm looking for a way to dynamically list only active codes with quantity above zero for each individual account.

Transactions are logged sequentially. There may be a buy order for 100 units of stock X, followed - several days afterwards - by a sell order for 50 units of the same stock, then another buy or sell, so on and so forth. If the sum is zero, it doesn't make sense to list stock ticker in the current asset list. I have already figured out a way to calculate the average acquisition cost that will be compared with the current stock price and displayed in the dashboard.

I'm under the impression QUERY wouldn't work as it would likely list all rows with quantity above zero, instead of just the most recent entry which might be zero.

I tried using MAXIFS but it lists the highest value for each given ticker code in associated with the account, and I'm interested in the most recent (lowest result down the transaction table)

XMATCH from bottom up (-1 flag) could work if I figure out how to use two criteria (Account and Ticker).

Here's a data sample:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16TDzquEzwW5kOlyb0MJDZBTFWuHLFALqqPMohvT3Hpk/edit 

I want to add the minimum possible additional columns to the transaction data, but can live with it. I need this to be as dynamic as possible, adding new accounts and tickers as time goes.

First row defines columns for Account, Tickers, Buys, Sells, and Qty (buys-sells).

AT = account and ticker columns combined/uniqued/sorted.  Offset is used to skip header row.

Q = quantities summed based on filter of account/ticker matching

ATQ = above two combined into 3 columns

out = filtered to hide zero quantities

Notes:

Entire column is specified like B:B instead of B2:B so ranges don't break if inserting/deleting a data row 2.  Offset is used to skip header row where needed.

Recommend you specify Sell as a negative quantity per convention, and/or get rid of separate columns for each and just have one Quantity column that is negative for Sell or positive for Buy.

I sorted your Desired Result by account/ticker for comparison to my formula.  There are a couple errors in your sample data so it doesn't match exactly.

>I have already figured out a way to calculate the average acquisition cost that will be compared with the current stock price and displayed in the dashboard.

This is fairly complex, requiring a weighted average of previous buy quantities/purchase prices, with any previous sales removed.

It also depends on how you remove those previous sales, i.e. do you realize gains/loses on a FIFO basis, average purchase price, or some other method.

googlesheets,Filtering drop-down selections like tags?,"I'm trying to take a list of  mental health providers published by a local organization and make it easier to search and filter for both myself and my coworkers.

Previously I was using Google Sheets to do some mass editing of the data and then uploading the document in notion to turn the relevant columns into ""Multi-select"" properties - creating tags that make it easier for folks to filter the list based on whatever criteria is relevant to them. When I learned that Sheets had a built in drop-down selection function my hope was that it could do something similar to remove one step from the process of updating t his list when it gets republished every few months. But maybe I just got tricked by seeing a similar visual and this isn't something sheets can do.

I have included a screenshot which shows the drop-downs I have available in a column for provider designation. My assumption would be that then the filter would show those same options but instead I get what is in the second screenshot. The filter seems to show what would be written if the columns were plain text - as in showing both ""CCC"" and ""CCC, RSW"" as separate entities to filter by.

I'm using this column as an example, but this is probably more relevant for my other columns that have far more combination possibilities. For example, I have a column for practice location where you will see ""Virtual"", ""City A, Virtual"", ""City A, City B"" ""City A City B, Virtual"", ""City B, Virtual"" ... which means that if I wanted to view everyone who offers ""virtual"" services I'm selecting over 100 different combination options.

Is there a way to make the filters work as I imagined - where selecting ""Virtual"" would show all providers who offer virtual services even in combination with other locations until you exclude those? Also ideally one that would be easy for my coworkers to take and create their own filters for their own needs:?

I Googled and didn't find any easy answer... and will be mad if there is one because I did it the hard way. :)

This solution assumes your users aren't editing anything, just viewing / filtering.

[Multi-Selection Filtering](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Vf2bzU_k5pwmbZadY63rJTIIZsnp3Vh0cP19W4Yadc/edit?gid=15709494#gid=15709494)

There are three sheets:

1. Filtered View - For users
2. Providers - Table edited by you
3. Dropdowns - Used in the other two sheets

For deployment, protect or protect/hide sheets 2 and 3.

**Filtered View**

**B1** pulls the table headers over

`=index(Providers[#HEADERS])`

You could display only certain columns instead, but make sure the names match the headers exactly, because the formula below uses them to automatically look up the appropriate column in the source table.

**Row 2** has the dropdowns specifying filtering.   Multiple criteria in the filter dropdowns is supported.  

Blank means ""all"" for that column.  So you can omit a dropdown entirely and it will filter as ""all"".

**B3** is a whopper, but only the first line should need to be modified, everything else flows from that.

    =let(sourceTable, Providers, filterColNames, B1:D1, 
     matches, bycol(filterColNames,lambda(filterColName, let(
       filterDrop,   offset(filterColName, 1, 0),
       fDropSplit,   map(split(filterDrop,"",""),lambda(f,trim(f))),
       sourceColNum, xmatch(filterColName, offset(sourceTable,-1,0,1)),
       colMatch,     map(offset(sourceTable,0,sourceColNum-1,,1), lambda(sourceCell, 
                     if(isblank(filterDrop), true, let(sCellSplit, map(split(sourceCell,"",""),lambda(s,trim(s))),

       colMatch))),
     filtered, filter(sourceTable, byrow(matches,lambda(r,countif(r,true)=columns(r)))),
     ifna(filtered, ""No matches""))

If you need to do this style filtering on an *editable* view, I would probably make a helper column that does all the complicated stuff above and outputs true/false for whether the row should be shown. And then...

* Set a filter on that helper column... but it won't auto-refresh when you change a filter dropdown, or...
* Group/filter on that column, then you at least get a message that your group is out of date, or...
* Write a script to forcibly update the filter so it refreshes whenever a dropdown was changed.

I'd probably go with the script after coming this far.  Idk if the editable view can then be in a Table, there isn't full apps script support for Tables.

For example, I want to change =ARRAYFORMULA(Sheet1!A2), then =ARRAYFORMULA(Sheet1!A3) every time i use the macro?

Thanks in advance.",12/11/24 0:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1hbni5c/automatically_change_range_in_arrayformula_using/,lieutenantbeer,"Alright. Just two notes. In this case you don't need to use ARRAYFORMULA. You can simply refer directly to the cells. The reason for this is that the formula simply refers to single cells. ARRAYFORMULA is used in conjunction with other functions that normally do not accept arrays (more than 1 cell) but since you don't use any other function and only refer to 1 cell, then ARRAYFORMULA isn't needed.

So for example you could input
=Sheet1!B2
instead of
=ARRAYFORMULA(Sheet1!B2)

I see you also use a formula to return a specific column/row in every cell (name, father's name, mother's name etc). You could replace all this with an OFFSET function that looks at ""Position Apply"" and then simply moves column to get the correct information. Your solution works, but it makes the script a little bit longer since it needs to check every single cell and update the row number every time. With OFFSET in the formulas the script could simply update ""Position Apply"" only and every other formula would update automatically without the script.

This script works with the way your CV template is organized right now. However I added an extra script. The script named incrementRow will do what you have asked. The second script named resetRow will reset the row to 2 in all formulas so that you can start from the beginning again if you want to.

I have hardcoded the script to look for formulas in the range A1:F35. If you ever need to expand this then update this line to include the range you want.

var formulas = sheet.getRange(""A1:F35"").getFormulas();

    function incrementRow() {
      var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
    
      var formulas = sheet.getRange(""A1:F35"").getFormulas();

        for (var col = 0; col < formulas[row].length; col++) {
          var formula = formulas[row][col];
          
          if (formula) {
            var updatedFormula = formula.replace(/([A-Z]+)(\d+)/g, function(match, column, rowNum) {
              return column + (parseInt(rowNum) + 1);

googlesheets,Project Tracker - Looking to change colour to X if cell B if cell D contains project type 1 or to colour Y if cell D contains project type 2,"Hey all,

Relatively new to sheets (and reddit), and just looking for help with the above. I am using sheets to track commissions orders and I want to colour code column B(recipient), which holds the requester name, based on the project type I set in column D(project type).

This will hopefully help me keep track colour-wise on the amount of each project I have.

Second question: once we have that done, is there a way to total up how much of each project I have in a new column/cell based on either column B's colour or column D's value (whichever is easiest)?  
e.g. 3 leatherwork, 5 beadwork.

Set Conditional Formatting for B2:B, choose whatever color you want, and set a Custom Formula to:

Write the formula from the perspective of the top-left cell in the range, and it will automatically adjust.

You will need to create a separate formula for each color desired.

=COUNTIF(D2:D, ""Leatherwork"")

Or if you later want to sum something like the price of project types, say price was in Column G...

=SUMIFS(G2:G, D2:D, ""Leatherwork"")

Note that in both these cases, it won't hurt to include the header row in your ranges.  And it will make your formulas more robust, i.e. if you delete your first data row, or insert a new row above it, your ranges will still be valid.

Data! is the sheet that's automatically filled by google forms, B1 is where I placed a dropdown menu with the 16 opportunities. Column L is where the volunteers can select the opportunities they're interested in.

The problem I'm running into is that the query is only returning results for the first opportunity they select. So, if a volunteer clicks to say they're interested in (for example) adoptions, kennel cleaning, and pantry organization, and I run a search for pantry organization, that volunteer won't pop up. But when I run a search for adoptions, they will.

So I would recommend a map() formula to generate it to ensure it is consistent across all rows, and use extra effort to make the range references as robust as possible.

I'd further suggest making it a general-purpose ""Visible"" helper column, rather than creating a dedicated column for each piece of data you want to summarize.

For the Visible column, pick some data that is *required* to be in every row, perhaps the team name, and do a COUNTA() subtotal 103 on that for each row, giving you a column full of 1s and 0s depending on whether the row is visible.

If you're doing this kind of thing a lot, maybe always put the Visible formula in column A for consistency so you don't have to think about it.

Side note suggestion: Don't use `sumif()` whenever you have a separate criteria range... use `sumifs()`  instead because the order of arguments makes more sense *(sum <this> if <this>)*, and you don't have to remember two ways of doing things when you have one criteria range vs multiple.

Your sum formulas then become:

Normal version:

`=sumifs(I4:I25, D4:D25, ""Marketing"")`

Filtered version:

`=sumifs(I4:I25, D4:D25, ""Marketing"", A4:A25, 1)`

So they are only slightly more complicated, and still sum the normal data columns, rather than a special hidden column.

Into B4 and then copy it down that column; can change the text within the single quotes to be unique to each column.

When i copied your sheet and tested it with different text; i noticed that you have several places where you either have multiple identical outcomes (like rough cut notes due EOD appeared on multiple dates for each numbered episode).  I also noticed that you didn't have a standardized 'fine cut notes due eod' in every column.  It just didn't appear in most of the columns.

The words I ended up using that had good results as unique enough were 'Rough Cut Due EOD', 'client Notes Due EOD', 'Fine Cut Due EOD', 'client FC Notes Due EOD', 'PL Cut Due EOD'.

I would have put it on a copied tab on your sheet but it's read only.  I noted that the headers on your search tab don't exactly match the text you put into your larger sheet (tsk tsk); but these are the phrases i used in the formula that seemed close enough.

googlesheets,Query function with Dynamic column reference. ,"So I have a sheet called “Data” in which I have my info. I want to create in a new sheet a Query function which sorts my data into descending order. 

Relevant info: Data sheet has Names in Column C of the sheet, and from Column D onwards I have different information, all numbers.

Seems simple enough, except I need the second column to be dynamically chosen. 

The column reference number (ie whether I need column 2,4,8 or 9) is in cell C2 of the sheet. 

I came up with this:

=QUERY(Data!B1:BX3000, ""SELECT C, "" & CHAR(64 + Data!C2) & "" WHERE "" & CHAR(64 + Data!C2) & "" IS NOT NULL ORDER BY "" & CHAR(64 + Data!C2) & "" DESC "", 1)



But for some reason it isnt sorting it in a descending order. Its kind of a haphazard number list instead. 

Ideally id also like an option to get the top 10 or bottom 10 as well.

Here is a link with some dummy data :

Got back on a computer and fixed the formula for you; did similar to what marc recommended for picking your data within a filter so then i could apply a VALUE function to the number column as I suggested.

I formatted the formulas as a LET here to separate out the ranges in case you ever need to change them, or like the sheet names.  Let just assigns the ranges to variable names.  In this case the formula is taking the column of words; then creating the column of number from the strings your formula outputs and combining it with the number column header cell (otherwise VALUE will give an error on the header cell).  Let me know if you have further questions about how it words or need it tweaked.

I also placed 2 more QUERY's on your sheet using the Asc and Desc sort with Limit 10 to give you the top 10 and bottom 10.  FYI, since you have so many zero's in the test data it's basically just picking first 10 rows with zero.  You could subsort the data by a second column if that mattered (if the real data would have so many tied values; like Order by Col2,Col1.

googlesheets,How to assign a value to specific words and how to isolate numbers from words in a cell,"Long story short, I want to be able to type out my shopping list each week and have sheets give me an estimated cost of the list.


I want the process to be simple enough that I can just type out “ground beef” “cat litter” or “paper towels” and the cost is already known (I plan on recording the cost of everything I buy into a master list for the reference).


But I don’t want to have to limit myself to only putting ground beef in a specific cell. I want to be able to write my list in any order I want and still have the same results.


My only guess could be using data validation to make the master list rather than making the list in sheets and then having each cell in the “item” column contain a drop down. I don’t know what formula to use that would assign a cost value to each item and I’m also not sure what function in the data validation section I should use, because the drop down option doesn’t allow me to give the item a value. 


I also have a quantity column that I want to be able to input “2 lbs” or “1 dozen” or ”3 liters”  and it multiplies only the quantity by the cost of an individual item without sheets being weird about it. I’m not sure what formula to use that would isolate only the numbers in the quantities and ignore the units of measure.


I haven’t had to use sheets like this before so I’m definitely on a learning curve. Thanks in advance

The prices are on a separate tab, in a sheets ""Table"".  That is primarily so table name references can be used on the first sheet.

The first sheet could also be turned into a ""Table"" if you preferred, in which case you'd use single-line formulas that were replicated for each row instead of the map() formulas I used, which would be simpler to understand.

But... brace yourself. :)

Cost column:

    =vstack(""Cost"", map(offset(A:A,row(),0),lambda(item, if(isblank(item),, 
     xlookup(item, Prices[Item], Prices[Cost])))))

`vstack()` outputs ""Cost"" header followed by output of the map() function

`map()` calls the lambda function for each row in the specified range

`offset(A:A,row(),0)` is a fancy way of saying ""Column A starting at the row below me"".  Here it is effectively the same as `A3:A` but it won't break if you delete row 3, or insert a new row above it.

`lambda()` is called with each cell in the range, assigned to the variable `item`.

`if(isblank(item)` checks if an item exists in this row, if not just outputs a blank, otherwise...

`xlookup()` looks up the item in the prices table using table references to refer to the entire column of Item and Price, and returns the price.

It's a lot to unpack for a beginner, but the first row is just a bunch of housekeeping stuff.

The second row with xlookup() is the actual work, and is essentially what you'd do if you were writing one formula per row.

Total Column:

    =vstack(""Total"", map(offset(B:B,row(),0), offset(C:C,row(),0),lambda(cost, qtyStr, if(isblank(qtyStr),, 
     let(qtyNum, regexextract(qtyStr, ""\d""), qtyNum * cost)))))

Similar pile of housekeeping stuff, then in the second row:

`let(qtyNum, regexextract(qtyStr, ""\d"")` Assigns qtyNum to the regex formula, which is extracting decimals from your quantity string containing both text and numbers.

`qtyNum * cost` outputs the total cost",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1haxi48/how_to_assign_a_value_to_specific_words_and_how/m1c3h9l/,mommasaidmommasaid,2,"`=vstack(""Cost"", map(offset(A:A,row(),0),lambda(item, if(isblank(item),,

I've tried looking online and the closest I've found to making it do what I want is putting ""=g2=g1"" in the ""custom formula is"", but it highlights the wrong cells.  Using ""=g2>g1"" has the same result but is inversed from when using the other. 

I've tossed in a screenshot that has what it's currently doing, what I want it to do, and what it looks like without any color changes. All the cells have the same text in each column, I just manually edited it in the way I want it to be automated.

This is the dynamic range that I set up. I set it up on 12/7 and so AC5 was =Today() and AC6 was =AC5-7 with that formula repeating down. in each of the sumifs columns I set it up so that it was checking if that AC column date fell into the weekly date ranges and then summing the appropriate column. It seemed to work fine when I set it up on 12/7 but this morning when I checked it everything was 0.

the formula hasn't changed at all, just the date in AC5. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I've tried putting different dates in but it only seems to work if the date I'm putting in AC5 is a saturday or a sunday so maybe the < and > aren't working and its not checking if AC falls in the date range but only if AC is either the start or the end of a week?",12/09/24 12:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1hagely/something_is_going_wrong_with_a_table_is_pulling/,SaintBonehead,"Based on your range, right now, you are looking at Column A for anything greater than or equal to 12/2/2024. So 12/15,12/22,12/29 would be the rows that fit that first criterion. These three rows will be the only ones looked at for the next criteria: column B for something LESS THAN or Equal to 12/9. The only dates would be 12/21/2024, 12/28/2024, 1/4/2025. None are less than, thus it ends in 0.  

  
So like you said, yes it works on certain days (weekend I believe, or Saturdays) it'll pick up based on one of those = to will pick up dates.  

Perhaps changing your formula to show the SUNDAY of the week to pick it up would work...

googlesheets,Dates get rounded and recieve unexpected millisecond time fraction during formula calculation,"Hi folks!

I noticed weird date behavior. Can anybody explain? As an example my input date is ""2/27/2024 20:58:35.000"" ie 45349.87401620370

Then I apply to this date a formula and I get this result

""2/27/2024 23:58:35.328"" ie 45349.99902000000

While it should be equal

""2/27/2024 23:58:35.000"" ie 45349.87401620370

The formula is quite complex but the **only** part where calculation on date takes place is like

    =IF(ISDATE(F8), F8 + TIME(3,,), SUM(SPLIT(F8, "" "")) + TIME(3,,))

(3rd IF's argument is for dates that cannot be recognized by Google Sheets due to reverse notation eg ""20:58:35 2-27-2024"" but that's not the point)

I would have to test with actual examples.

In Excel, dates are stored as integers (days since 12/31/1899), and time is stored as a fraction of a day (i.e. 1 hr = 1/24).

It's the latter that causes problems because most decimal fractions cannot be represented in binary exactly.  And the binary approximation of a particular decimal fraction varies, depending on the magnitude of the number.

A simple decimal example is:  IF(10.1 - 10 = 0.1, TRUE) returns FALSE (!).

Generally, the work-around is to round explicitly.  Usually I recommending using TEXT for that purpose.  But it can be tricky when dates are involved, especially if you need to avoid local differences -- dates in the form MDY, DMY or YMD.

Just a brief response with the highlights, to give you a quick response.  I'll look at your examples in detail.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gixczw/dates_get_rounded_and_recieve_unexpected/m18b0e5/,Curious_Cat_314159,1,,,,,,,

I’m about to have a total meltdown and know it’s just something dumb I’m missing. My mind is elsewhere with a lot of personal things going on the last 30 days and for whatever reason I’m just stuck and overwhelmed. 

Unfortunately my client will not accept a delay on this. 

Any help!?!? I will gladly pay someone to write this formula for me within the next 12 hours if you can get it done. 

I can send you the data dump tab and the processed tab. I’m sure it’s hard to trust anyone these days but I can only give my word I’ll pay via Venmo or PayPal “friends and family” as soon as it’s done and in my possession. 

Desperate times yall lol



I’ll add that the reason I’m struggling is the data  dump has merged cells with titles etc in column a. I know how to filter by numbers only to ignore the unneeded rows but I cannot figure out how to get the rest of row for the cells pulled in while ignoring certain columns. Just gives me a formula with array and filter

=XLOOKUP(1,('Sheet 1'!$A$1:$A$50000=B$1)\*('Sheet 1'!$B$1:B$50000=$A2),'Sheet 1'!$C$1:$C$50000)

But whenever I use it it gives a N/A error.

Why is that happening? I broke it down to check which criteria is giving the 0 to the boolean and it is the second one with the Source ID name. What can I do to fix it?

See table - yellow cell is where I'm trying to make it work.

I've partially written the IF statement I was thinking of putting into the cell, likely via array formula (tried to do MAP but couldn't work out how to sort the arrays in there just yet) - this is below the table.

Where I'm getting stuck is, if  a stock is sold, I want to somehow have the formula look for the stock's oldest purchase date, then use the purchase price from that row, multiplied by the units being sold (- number) to effectively work out how much profit was made:

e.g. (sold unit price \* number of units sold) - (oldest purchase unit price \* number of units sold)

Tried V/X look up but couldn't work out how to request the oldest date for the stock name, not just the stock name.

  
Edit just for clarity; this means that the ""earning sale"" column should really only have anything calculated if the row is a sale (e.g. row 8 would be the only one for which the formula activates, resulting in an output of $1493.5, by using G2's price as that is the oldest date) ",12/06/24 19:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1h8hmz6/search_for_the_oldest_reference_to_an_item_in/,tkd1900,"Yes, copy the formula from the sample sheet, which uses A2 (in the first row) for the ticker to filter on rather than the Table style name...

Regarding array formulas, they just don't play nice with Tables.  Google developers in their wisdom didn't give us any header rows to put them in.  Rather than fighting that design decision I think you're better off using standard formulas, which they do at least make it easy to autofill in the table.

This is a version with a copy of the formula in each cell to start with... it's easier to understand, and to see if it's what you want before doing the fancier all-in-one formula.

This is a sample formula in C5:

    =let(d, C$3, t, $B5, 
         sClient, 'Session Journal'!$B:$B, sDate, 'Session Journal'!$A:$A, sStart, 'Session Journal'!$G:$G, sEnd, 'Session Journal'!$H:$H,
         client, filter(sClient, sDate = d, t >= sStart, t < sEnd),
         ifna(client))

The first couple rows are part of a let() which assigns names to ranges. This keeps the housekeeping up front and out of the main formula, which would otherwise be a pile of spaghetti, especially with ranges referencing another sheet.

This is the main formula. We are still in the let() statement, so it's setting `client` to the filter results:

    client, filter(sClient, sDate = d, t >= sStart, t < sEnd)

Finally, the result returned as the last un-paired parameter of the let():

`ifna(client)` which hides #n/a from filter results that return empty.

\---

I also changed the Total Sessions formulas from sum() to:

`=counta(unique(C5:C44))`

This relies on the Client names being unique, and that they they only schedule one session per day.  Is that acceptable?

googlesheets,Count current and longest streak over calendar,"Hello,

I have a sheet ([Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SDPh5hFugiYwHII86ozZ-QwUCn-Srt16uQiaqOot8HY/edit?usp=sharing)) where I have a daily calendar over a range, where the columns B through H are the days of the week, and the rows are the dates of the given week, which I guess will just expand forever. Each cell contains a duration representing how long I spent on a task for that day. I would like to have something that calculates the current and longest streak over the entire range, including whenever I add more data in the future. To be valid for the streak I should have spent at least **30 minutes** on the task during a given day.

As you can see, the latest date filled out is Friday the 6th, on G8. I don't want it to count any blank cells, so this should be considered the ""current"" day. Since E8 is below 30 minutes and is a fail, the current streak should be 2. The longest streak takes place between H6 and G5, for 9.

I tried to google similar solutions but had a lot of trouble trying to convert it to my sheet. I'm a novice and don't really understand anything beyond very basic formulas, so I had a hard time going between rows to count the streak.

Any help is very greatly appreciated!

EDIT: Thank you very much everyone!

I added a 'Helper"" column at the very end of that tab, to help figure the 3/4d conversions. I needed it because I couldn't figure out how to use COUNTIFS along with a comparison (it's possible it can be done, but if so, it's far beyond my knowledge, while adding a helper column is simple). I put it at the end of the tab so that it wouldn't shift any other columns over to the right. This way, you keep all the columns in all of the tabs in the same order, so copy-pasting your formulas for the other tabs doesn't mess anything up. 

It's a simple formula in the helper column -- =-G2+I2 -- then copied all the way down. It takes the negative of the DIST, then adds in the GN/LS -- so for the first cell, since it's 2nd and 10, but the team lost 5, it shows as ""-15"". This should mean that whenever the Helper column shows a 0 or a positive number, the team got the first down.

Then, for the Efficients formula, I did 4 iterations of the COUNTIFS, one for each down (I'll separate them here into different lines, to make it easier, but you'd keep them all together in the actual spreadsheet):

* =COUNTIFS('APOLLO/CREED'!$I$2:$I,"">=4"",'APOLLO/CREED'!$F$2:$F,""1"")
* \+COUNTIFS('APOLLO/CREED'!$I$2:$I,"">=4"",'APOLLO/CREED'!$F$2:$F,""2"")
* \+COUNTIFS('APOLLO/CREED'!$F$2:$F,""3"", 'APOLLO/CREED'!$AB$2:$AB,"">=0"")
* \+COUNTIFS('APOLLO/CREED'!$F$2:$F,""4"", 'APOLLO/CREED'!$AB$2:$AB,"">=0"")

The first two will count every time there is a 4+ gain for a 1st or 2nd down, and the last two will count every time there is a conversion on a 3rd or 4th down -- i.e., every time that the team gained the same or more yards than was in the DIST column.

The only problem is that this formula gives a total of 15 efficients, but your manually-entered data said 16. Look at the data again and see if it should say 16 or if there was a typo somewhere -- either it should have been only 15, or there was a typo in either the DIST or GN/LS column so that something should have been counted as an efficient and wasn't.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1h4xulv/data_input_automation_to_sheet/m0ph8c3/,OutrageousYak5868,1,"`=COUNTIFS('APOLLO/CREED'!$I$2:$I,"">=4"",'APOLLO/CREED'!$F$2:$F,""1"")","`=COUNTIFS('APOLLO/CREED'!$I$2:$I,"">=4"",'APOLLO/CREED'!$F$2:$F,""1"")",,,,,

This means that using those numbers as parameters like the max always show the full bar instead of showing it correctly.  The fix is to round to the nearest integer via ROUND (or any other rounding function) to get rid of the decimal (comma) in the parameter and it works correctly.  The other fix is to change locale to one that doesn't do that like USA.

Hello everyone, 

I currently have a Google Form sheet linked to my Google Sheet, which adds entries to the main sheet and is filtered out by my mirrored sheet. The problem I am having is getting the conditional formatting to work when color-coding my columns.

Here is a [sample sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aYNiAIwDulIeJRC35h6g7NDA9iFIqFYzeRGbboDvfG0/edit?gid=360964385#gid=360964385) I have made for review. Essentially what I am trying to do is have columns A to F in the ""Image,"" sheet which is the filtered sheet, to automatically change colors when column E contains a certain value. For example, I want column A-F to change colors to red with white bold font when a cell in column E is 0, meaning all the rows corresponding to that cell when changed to that color and font. If any cells in column E are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, I want that to be orange with black bold font. If any cells in column E are 8,9,10,11,12,13,14, I want that to be yellow with black bold font. You can see what I am trying to do in column E (see image above), except I want that for the whole row. Any help is appreciated. 

Ultimately I want the image sheet to automatically color code based on those conditions when new entries are added to the main MasterSheet by Google Forms.

What I'd like to be able to write out to define the consistency is something like ""find cells where the previous X cells are <=Y%, then the next cell is >=z%"".  So for Rich, his E4 cell would qualify if i could say ""find cells where the previous 3 cells are <=10%, then the next cell is >=90%.""

It might be a bit risky though, so start with a copy of your sheet, in case it effs it up.

You can also make a conditional formatting rule, that highlights some specific range (or make a rule for all your ranges) and highlight every reference, using formulatext and then search, or find, to look for a particular range.

I would probably go this route and just change it manually. Just work with one range at a time and highlight and replace as needed.

That clarification is very helpful.  Here's what you can do.  Create a test sheet that you can share the link to with 'anyone with link can edit' permissions.

On this sheet, make some dropdowns on one tab and then highlight the cells where you want stuff automatically filled in.  In another place (to the side or another tab) create a table of 2 columns: stuff in the dropdown in the first column and what you want populated in the new cells in the second column.

This can be done via a lookup table with a function such as XLOOKUP.  It will take your dropdown selection and then lookup the correct result from the table you created and return it to the cell next to the dropdown.

googlesheets,"Automatically have ""User's"" sheet be the 2nd sheet for the logged-in user?","Hi Everyone,

I'm new to this forum, and am much less experienced in Google Sheets than Excel. I'm getting used to it, and as I learn, I like it more and more.

I have a Google Sheets workbook with multiple worksheets -- one each for about 30 people. Each worksheet is protected so only the respective user (and I) can edit their own sheet. So, the ""Bob"" sheet can only edited by Bob, the ""Jane"" sheet can only be edited by Jane, and so forth.

With so many sheets, and many users making their updates on their phones, there's a lot of scrolling to try to find their assigned sheet. So, I'd like to do the following:

1. At the top of each sheet, enter the Google Drive email address for each user of that respective sheet

2. When a user logs in, a script will use an onOpen() funtion to move their sheet (based on the email address at the top of the sheet matching the logged-in user) to the front (i.e. be the first tab -- actually, ideally, the 2nd tab, as the first tab is a summary tab)

I know just enough about writing macros in Excel to basically record and edit them. But, I'm at a loss to where to start for this use case.

googlesheets,What's better practice? Multiple ImportRanges vs Single ImportRange + Manipulation,"I'm currently looking at a formula which imports 4 tables with 3 columns each (placed side by side) from a single tab from another sheet and stacks them on top of each other.

Here's what the formula looks like:

Are these 3 ImportRange calls processed separately or does gsheets load all the data and then extract the ranges I want afterwards? If the function calls are processed separately, would it be better to just use one ImportRange to import the whole tab and then stack the tables using arrays + ranges + query afterwards?

If you've got a better way to stack tables than this method please let me know as well. Thanks for your help :)",12/03/24 2:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1h5j81r/whats_better_practice_multiple_importranges_vs/,hyw_ell,"If your data is similar to that example, i.e. you are trying to combine tables that each have the same 4 columns, that formula isn't going to work.

I prefer using VSTACK() and HSTACK() for readability rather than { , } and { ; } and for consistency with places where the formula is required.

Line breaks help a lot for clarity here too (ctrl-enter in the formula box).

So unless I'm misunderstanding your formula should be something like:

    =QUERY(VSTACK(
           QUERY(IMPORTRANGE(), ""select 4 columns"", 1),
           QUERY(IMPORTRANGE(), ""select 4 columns"", 0),

           ""select * where (Col1 is not null AND Col2 is not null)"", 1)

Don't forget the headers parameter on your QUERY.  The above would be if your import was including header rows from each table.  Only the first QUERY grabs the header row in so you don't get duplicates.

Or be sure you actually need the inner queries, rather than just specifying the ranges in IMPORTRANGE.

Regarding efficiency... I would \*guess\* that the primary performance hit is establishing a link with the spreadsheet. Since the first IMPORTRANGE() does that, then I would think additional imports on the same spreadsheet should be fast.

But I'd just write it the way that is the least work / most easily read / maintained, and don't worry about it unless performance suffers.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1h5j81r/whats_better_practice_multiple_importranges_vs/m094xs3/,mommasaidmommasaid,1,"`=QUERY(VSTACK(

googlesheets,"Looking to filter a table that tracks when events occur, where the event can occur at variable intervals, but are only considered valid if enough time has elapsed since the last valid event.","Hello! Sorry for the wordy title. It's likely easiest to understand through the [sample sheet,](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p2wNUU32Ute1yVn9Rl_-9QerouVpyWEAvEzKEnFXP94/edit?usp=sharing) but I will write a bit below in case additional context is needed.

Specifically, I'm looking for a way to do this ideally within a single formula, or within a single column. I can do it with a helper table but I figured this would be a good learning moment. Thanks for the time and help!

To give a concrete example, let's say we have the value ""X"" occurring at 1, 3, and 5 seconds. Valid occurrences need to have a 3 second interval between them. So *1* is valid as our first occurrence, *3* is only 2 seconds after *1* and is thus invalid, while *5* is 4 seconds after our last valid occurrence and thus is valid.",12/01/24 0:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1h3wqb0/looking_to_filter_a_table_that_tracks_when_events/,Mart-n,"    =let(times, filter(A2:A,B2:B>0), minDelay, 10, 
     validTimes, scan(-minDelay, times, lambda(lastValidTime, currentTime, 
        if(currentTime-lastValidTime >= minDelay, currentTime, lastValidTime))),
     unique(validTimes))

As I understand it you just wanted the valid times, i.e. X is just a marker? And you didn't specify exactly what qualifies as ""X"" but I used > 0.

`times` = Only the marked times.

`validTimes` = Current time if it's valid, or repeat the last valid time.  scan() uses -minDelay as the starting value for lastValidTime, which ensures the first currentTime is counted as valid.

`unique` = Get rid of the duplicates

With more complicated formulas like this, I like using let to give each stage of the formula a name. That allows you to build each stage individually, and the individual stages can be easily displayed for debugging.

See your sample sheet for an example, where the same formula is used but I output each stage separately.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1h3wqb0/looking_to_filter_a_table_that_tracks_when_events/m08ipxv/,mommasaidmommasaid,2,"`=let(times, filter(A2:A,B2:B>0), minDelay, 10,

Two problems: 

1 - The problem is that your simplistic calendar is creating months from weeks/4 which means 13 months per year instead of 12 so the calculations are off.  Notice it says 50 weeks but 13 months?

If you want a calendar. You should divide weeks by 4.3333 and just use number formatting to not show the decimal but the real number in there is preserved for calculations. You could divide by the true fraction but this should be accurate enough for this case. 

2 - Edit. It’s also bc of the circular logic in the calculation. I recreated the calculation with decimals and the problem is that the year cell (as you calculate it) contains the true fraction of a year. Not just 1. So it’s always going to subtract to zero. Change your year cell to force it to round down to the nearest full year and that will help fix it when you subtract months-years*12.

You may also want to use let() to enhance readability especially when you get into this many columns.

But it seems like the ""Jack of all trades"" 2 points should be excluded if *either* of the other checkboxes are selected, assuming those stand for ""Proficient"" and ""Expert"".

The interface is a little strange because both Proficient and Expert being checked at the same time doesn't make sense... you could replace that with a dropdown if that bothers you.  Or perhaps one dropdown per row could replace all 3 checkboxes.

Regardless it seems to me the highest level of expertise should take precedence in determining points values.

So this would be a more correct calculation, and is also a lot easier to follow rather than the stacked arithmetic:

googlesheets,If formula to assume regular work hours maxing at 16.,"Edit to add: I'm only able to work on this from my phone so i have had some difficulty parsing so if that's the issue somehow please lmk

I'm not exactly knowledgeable about the formulas and capabilities of Google sheets. I'm just trying to throw something together to assume my scheduled hours, compare that to my actual Hours, and assume my paycheck before taxes. I'm sure there are better ways to do this than I'm doing, and while I'm open to suggestions, I'm mainly curious why I'm having this issue.

To start,I'll explain what I have set up. Cells A5 and B5 are mergaed, and C5 and D5 are merged. Cell A5 is my scheduled start time, C5 is end time. They're merged because a7 is my actual start, and b7 is my break start. These cells will not be relevant tho, just that the others are merged possibly.
E5 contains the formula ""=IF((C5-A5)>(TIME(4,0,0)),((C5-A5)-(TIME(0,30,0))),(C5-A5))"" set to display as duration, which accurately determes my scheduled hours and automatically assumes a 30 minute break on a shift longer than 4 hours. This cell functions properly but is referenced in the problem formula.
The problem formula being ""=IF((SUM(E5, J5, O5, T5, Y5, AD5, AI5))>(TIME(40,0,0)),(TIME(40,0,0)),(SUM(E5, J5, O5, T5, Y5, AD5, AI5)))"" also set to display as duration, which works until the total surpasses 16 hours. Where it simply stops increasing and always displays 16. Interestingly, just ""=(SUM(E5, J5, O5, T5, Y5, AD5, AI5))"" will accurately add the hours. My issue is it will just count OVER 40. I know I could just use this in one cell and make a different cell display 40 if this cell is higher and then handle ot, but I don't want a placeholder cell where it isn't necessary, and I'm curious why this formaul maxes at 16.

To specify E5, J5, O5, T5, Y5, AD5, and AI5 are Sunday to Saturday. Each being the relative formula as earlier exemplified for E5,variables adjusted to the proper cells for each day of the week.

Side note. Replacing ""=(SUM(E5, J5, O5, T5, Y5, AD5, AI5))"" with ""=(E5+J5+O5+T5+Y5+AD5+AI5)"" functions identically in both scenarios so that doesn't fix the issue with the IF formula.",12/02/24 12:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1h52gsz/if_formula_to_assume_regular_work_hours_maxing_at/,Mundane-Serve-5120,"You should change your formula to just be like

    =IF(C5-A5>(4/24),C5-A5-(0.5/24),C5-A5)

And for the other one just change TIME(40,0,0) to

    =IF(SUM()>(40/24),40/24,SUM())

This  is because in Sheets a day is the integer 1; so an hour is (1/24) and half-hour is (0.5/24) as numbers.  No need for time function at all.

For more explanation; it's not like TIME() is maxing out; it's that when you put over 24 in the hours slot in TIME it's wraps into the next day; so TIME(25,0,0) will read 1am; which is just the nature of how the function behaves.  It also rounds fractional hours down to the whole hour.

I have made many sheets over the years that I use daily, but today, I suddenly noticed that the borders in *all* of my sheets have changed. Instead of the usual 1-pixel solid black border, I have this weird semi-translucent border that's 2 pixels thick.

https://i.imgur.com/DffjQ5P.png

Does anyone else experience this change? Is there a way to change back? Re-applying the 1-pixel border does nothing except create this weird 2-pixel translucent border again. And besides, I don't quite fancy having to go through years' worth of sheets to re-apply all borders

I am using the web version on Firefox

UPDATE: It gets even weirder. I found one sheet that doesn't have this issue, and it caused me to investigate. If the sheet has only **ONE** border serving as a single horizontal/vertical line, then it appears just normal as 1 pixel solid black.

However, if I add a second border *anywhere* on the sheet, suddenly all borders turns into this weird translucent style, including the border/line that was fine before. If I remove this added border and revert to just 1 border, it turns back to normal. See these following images:

It looks normal if it's just 1 line: https://i.imgur.com/Qa60zA4.png

I have built a main page where I can pick the wood species, thickness, and input dimensions of desired material (the species and thickness are all derived from the second sheet/tab.) It will then figure the board footage for me. It's at this point I'm getting stuck. I am hoping to have the calculator then take the variables I've entered so far and pull in the pricing data from a second sheet/tab. 

Ideally, the calculator will see that I've chosen (for example..) ""Ash at 1"" thick"" and search the second tab for those variables and display the corresponding price. After that point, I have the next cell (in theory..) set up to calculate a price based on the amount of material I need and the price that has just been referenced and displayed.

As far as I’m aware this is the only way (and it only really works for line and scatter plots unless you want the things like bar chart columns to be coming down from the top). You can easily invert the data with an ARRAYFORMULA() function, e.g. =ARRAYFORMULA(-B:C), assuming your y-axis data is in columns B and C. This will create a helper array that your chart can read off of and will update whenever you update in column B or C.

To get the graph to be a little more visually appealing/believable you can open the chart editor pane, go to the Customize tab, expand the Vertical axis menu, and

•	⁠Set the y-axis maximum to -1
•	⁠Set the y-axis minimum to -15 or whatever the lowest place value is, multiplied by -1
•	⁠In the Number format dropdown select Other custom formats, type 0;0 in the box and hit Apply.

Second: Your formulas were very close! You needed to:

1. swap the comma for a semicolon to match the syntax required for your location; and
2. start each formula with an equal sign. The formula for the red rule had one but the other two rules didn't.

For anyone following along with this, the formulas for the rules are as follows:

* Red rule (listed first): `=AND($F1<>""""; $F1<=TODAY()+3)`
* Yellow rule (listed second): `=AND($F1<>"""";$F1<=TODAY()+7)`
* Green rule (listed third): `=AND($F1<>"""";$F1>TODAY()+7)`

All three rules are active in your linked sample sheet and are all currently applied to the range: `F1:F`

To extend beyond the single cell, you can just change the ""Apply to range"" field within each rule to be whatever columns you want it to apply to.

googlesheets,Formula for calculating total points directly from results?,"Say there is a competition where competitors are awarded points based on their finishing position in a given event. Is there a formula I can use to automatically calculate a competitor's points earned over a series of events using only the results, as opposed to creating a separate table to manually enter points earned and using the SUM function? Pictured is an example spreadsheet showing a points system and a results table.

Long story short, the ""simpler"" way of doing this requires keeping two separate tables, which can easily become very time consuming with competitions featuring 20+ competitors. From what little I have been able to read into solving this problem, I should be able to use =sum(switch(range, 0, 0, 1, 35, 2, 32, 3, 29, etc)), but that is either wrong or something else is amiss.

googlesheets,"Conditional Formatting: Trying to change the color of cells in a column based on the text in multiple rows
","TL;DR I want the dates in Column A to change colors if any cell in that row contains a time.

My boss is a voter for the Tonys and has to see as many new Broadway shows as possible (a charmed life, I know). I built this Google sheet for the both of us to keep track of A) when she’s in NYC, B) when each show is running performances, and C) if she’s already booked a ticket/seen a show. I’ve got a decent chunk of conditional formatting on this thing to make it as at-a-glance friendly as possible, but since there are over 30 productions opening this season, I’ve found myself trying to book her for a show in Column F, forgetting that she already has a ticket for the show in Column AQ because we can't immediately see it. It would be great if there was a way to make the date automatically turn blue once I’ve written a time for a show, so I know that date’s out of the running for other productions. 

Here’s a link to a mini version of the spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moDdDF4GNSMZ5-bf66yGO9dThqOaoyOAiiv4I7tSdL4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moDdDF4GNSMZ5-bf66yGO9dThqOaoyOAiiv4I7tSdL4/edit?usp=sharing)

Here’s what I’ve got going on in this sheet already:

* Rows 1-3 are a checklist - requested show tickets, received a confirmation, and sat through a performance. 
* Column A is the date
* Column B is my boss’ location (in NYC, traveling, OOO, etc). If she’s in NYC, the cell in that column turns light green.
* Columns C and onward are each production opening this season. If the show is running, but my boss is anywhere other than NYC, the cell in the show column turns yellow. 
* If my boss is in town at the same time that a show is running, the cell in the show column turns dark green.
* The last day of performances says “Closing” and the cell turns red.
* If we’ve requested a ticket to a performance and have a time confirmed, I list the time in the corresponding cell and it turns blue. 
* Once she’s *actually* seen the show, I check the “Seen” box, and the entire column greys out, so I know it’s no longer relevant. 

So again - I want the date cell in Column A to also turn blue once I’ve entered a time in *any* corresponding row, so that I can immediately tell that a show is booked for that day and I can’t schedule anything else. I’ve attempted ""=AND"" formulas and ""=COUNTIF"" fomulas, but I honestly don’t know enough about custom formulas to understand what I’m doing.

I want to make Column D display a list of all artists that appear in Column B. It should separate out groups of multiple artists and only show an artist name once, even if the list contains multiple songs from the same artist.

**Please refer to the attached image for the list I am aiming to create.**

# The PAIN

This problem has a few catches. I could easily just make a list that uses the UNIQUE or FILTER functions to filter out duplicates, but separating out multiple artists is a real issue for me. See the following caveats:

**1 - Account for Multiple Artists**  
Column D needs to split instances where there are multiple artists listed when separated by commas and ampersands (&). For example, the song ""Good Time"" is made by ""Carly Rae Jepsen & Owl City"", so ""Carly Rae Jepsen"" should be listed in its own cell separate from ""Owl City""

**2 - Account for Ampersand Exceptions**  
Column D needs to adhere to the exceptions listed out in Column C, as it lists artist names that on purposely utilize ampersands (&). For example, the artist ""Earth, Wind, & Fire"" is listed as an exception, so it should NOT be separated as ""Earth"", ""Wind"", and ""Fire"". It should just be listed as ""Earth, Wind, & Fire"".

**3 - Account for Partial Matches with Ampersand Exceptions**  
Column D needs to ignore when an artist name partially contains a match to an exception in Column C. For example, the artist ""piri & tommy"" should NOT be separated as ""piri"" and ""tommy"", as it is listed as an exception in Column C.

However, ""piri"" is also a valid artist name on its own, as the song ""luv stuck"" was made by ""piri"" and ""salute"". So both ""piri & tommy"" and ""piri"" should appear as separate artist cells in Column C.

**4 - Remove Exact-Case Duplicates**  
Of course, I would like to remove duplicates. This could probably be done with a UNIQUE function at the very end.

\-----

# So Basically...

Here is a screenshot of what I am aiming to achieve. Column E is what I would ideally want to have appear in Column D. The pipe dream right now is to just have one formula in D2 to output that whole list.

The current logic flow I'm trying to use is:\\  
**1**. Get all artists in Column B (Maybe as an array?).  
**2**. Separate all artists broken up by a comma into separate items or cells.  
**3**. If an item or cell contains an ampersand (&) and is NOT one of the exception items from Column C, separate the artists into separate items or cells.  
**4**. Remove all case-exact duplicates.  
**5**. Display all items in Column D, where each artist is drawn in its own cell.

googlesheets,Persistent timestamp formula - is this the best I can do?,"I've been successfully timestamping rows in a Sheets doc using a nested IF statement; I'm trying to get feedback on whether this is the simplest I can get.

The formula I use creates a timestamp in A22 when a value is added in Column B22. During cell updates or if B22 is modified, the value doesn't change. If B22 is cleared or evaluated as 0, however, A22 goes back to nothing.

Here's what I do to make it happen:

1 - Turned iterative calculation ON for the spreadsheet, apparently necessary because it references itself.

2 - The self-referencing formula is this, shown for Cell A22:

`=IF(B22<>"""", IF(OR(A22="""",A22=0) ,Today(), A22), """")`

I counted the watched and unwatched epusides using the Countif formulas:

=COUNTIF(B2:B23,TRUE)+COUNTIF(F2:F23,TRUE)+COUNTIF(J2:J23,TRUE) - to count watched episodes, and:

=COUNTIF(B2:B23,FALSE)+COUNTIF(F2:F23,FALSE)+COUNTIF(J2:J23,FALSE) - for not watched yet.

Though I'm not sure if that's correct, there's probably much better way to do so.

I've no idea what the furmula is to count all episodes from all three seasons. And how do I turn it all into the charts? And how do I count the average rating of each season in a scale 1-5 (M7 for season 1 etc)? I hope you beautiful people might be able to help!

They could be trying to pull data from a tab via the tab name or more likely the tab ID so you might have to modify the code.

A normal method here would be to have scripts look at a consolidated tab that you create using QUERY or FILTER to consolidate the data from your old stuff and the current form responses.  Then, you could always change those formulas to look at new tabs instead of changing scripts.

googlesheets,GOOGLEFINANCE returning Monday close price for Saturdays and Sundays,"During a project, I've noticed when using GOOGLEFINANCE to check the % change between two days, that there is change between Friday and Saturday.

For some reason Saturday and Sunday apparently get the closing price as of the following Monday.

If it was so easy that GOOGLEFINANCE could see through the future and new the closing price of Monday already on Saturday, that would be great for my future finance, but unfortunately it's not so.

Do anyone a way around this, so that Saturday and Sunday rather keeps the closing price of Friday.  
That way I can compare Monday with either Friday, Saturday or Sunday to get the correct change for Monday, without needing to manually adjust to Check between Monday and Friday for each weekend.

EXAMPLE  
Friday 22nd Nov. 2024 ""=INDEX(GOOGLEFINANCE(""INDEXSP:.INX"",""close"",DATE(2024,11,22),2,2)"" => 5969.34  
Saturday 23rd Nov 2024 ""=INDEX(GOOGLEFINANCE(""INDEXSP:.INX"",""close"",DATE(2024,11,22),2,2)"" => 5987.37  
Sunday 24th Nov 2024 ""=INDEX(GOOGLEFINANCE(""INDEXSP:.INX"",""close"",DATE(2024,11,24),2,2)"" => 5987.37  
Monday 25th Nov 2024 ""=INDEX(GOOGLEFINANCE(""INDEXSP:.INX"",""close"",DATE(2024,11,25),2,2)"" => 5987.37

  
Wouldn't it be way more reasonable to let Saturday and Sunday hold on to Friday closing price instead of changing them after Monday has closed?

Hoping there might be a way around this without changing every single weekend manually.

I am trying to create a graph on google sheets that shows how many of each response value I got for my various questions. But, when I try to make a chart it is showing each individual response by itself rather than grouping for example if I got 5 responses with a value of 10, grouping those all together and showing that on the graph. The first picture that I am including has the raw data and the second picture has the data when I sorted each column by numerical order. In the first picture there is also a photo of what the graph currently looks like. The third picture that I am including is what I would like my graph to look like, one graph per survey question (but with values of -10 to 10, rather than 0 to 10 like is in the picture). I tried to just use one column to make a graph and what I got for that will be in the fourth picture. I know theres probably some obvious way to do what I want to I'm just not that familiar with Sheets. Thank you in advance

Then put this second formula in cell B1.

Then you can create charts from the counts.  I suggest column charts; treat colum A as labels, treat labels as text, then just make sure the range of each chart is correct; Column A for X-axis, and whichever column for your counts.

Your sheet is view only.  if you change to allow editing I can paste the formulas in and add the first 2 graphs as I've made them.

Ok.  Then make another new tab with the same number scale formula in A1.  This time use this new formula in B1.

    =BYCOL('Raw Data'!A1:O1,LAMBDA(y,{y;BYROW($A$2:$A$22,LAMBDA(x,COUNTIF(INDIRECT(""'Raw Data'!C""&(COLUMN(y)),false),x)&"" (""&TEXT(COUNTIF(INDIRECT(""'Raw Data'!C""&(COLUMN(y)),false),x)/COUNTA(INDIRECT(""'Raw Data'!R2C""&column(y)&"":C""&column(y),false)),""0%"")&"")""))}))

This formula is creating custom text labels for each graph in columns.  It's the only way with a column chart to get both the count and percent of total into the labels.  So after you create each chart from the numberscale X-axis and the Y-axis from the first new tab.  You go to chart setup, tap the 3 dots next to the Y-axis series; and click ""add labels"" then select the corresponding column from this second new tab which will be your data labels.

Edit.  I went ahead and pasted the data and everything into a test sheet.

Delete the G column; place into G6.  If you get a 'parse error' then swap all commas for semicolons (that's a regional thing).

Edit.  Slightly altered to be a LET function.  This allows the list of tickers to avoid as well as the other column ranges to be at the front of the function and only listed once. (Except the BYROW range, that has to be separate in this case). If you want to add or delete them, just keep the list separated by vertical bars (pipes) like I have the 2 tickers there.

You could also do XLOOKUP with a compound key and an arrayformula to handle a lookup range with multiple columns, but I find the FILTER solution to be simpler in cases like these. 

Either way, sharing the columns / layout would be helpful if you want a more specific formula written for you.

googlesheets,Joining up text values into a sentence while skipping empty cells,"Hello!

I've been trying to find a solution for my situation, but for now I only saw the solutions of other people who were doing calculations with numbers using ISBLANK argument. I've made a copy of my working sheet with example information here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DDQ1w4I8p84clThBP6FvEC3fU9DVXuXM9KSmI1DxPTs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DDQ1w4I8p84clThBP6FvEC3fU9DVXuXM9KSmI1DxPTs/edit?usp=sharing)

On Sheet 2 a certain information is gathered and a formula is used to make a sum of numbers in E2:S2 (for the example file sum is converted into plain numbers). On Sheet 1, I'm gathering a quick data summary based on whether E2:S2 values are bigger than 0. If they are, a corresponding abbreviation is shown, if it's 0, than an abbreviation is skipped.

Also, on Sheet 1 there is a text template that is being sent via external sources and I'd like this template to contain the abbreviations that are currently bigger than 0. But the abbreviations with a current value of 0 create blank spaces which makes the text a bit ugly so to speak.

Is there a way I can ""ask"" the formula to get information from a certain range, but skip empty cells rather than return empty space? Any help or hints would be much appreciated.

googlesheets,Pulling specific values from a column to create totals,"Hi, spreadsheet newbie here. Just looking to learn

Built a spreadsheet to track stats for my video game Fifa career mode.

I had one sheet where I track each game going on across the season. I can put the scores in and then i've taken to inputting goal scorers and their goals next to them in brackets as you can see in attached picture.

I've then been manually adding them to a totals table simply to make cross reference between the sheet and the game easier.

I was looking for a way to have a cell on the table automatically do so, by searching the range of the column, find the players name, and then count the value within the bracket to add up the complete total. So ie it would count all assists for a player, all goals etc. Without me having to manually input as I go along.

However i've struggled as the cells have multiple players names and numbers in, is there a formula to count the number within the brackets, for a specific player, across a range of cells, to create a grand total?

EXAMPLE;

CELL A1 - Player 1 (2), Player 2 (1)  
CELL A2 - Player 1 (1), Player 2 (1)

Totals table would then count Player 1 with a total of 3 and player 2 with a total of 2. Hopefully this makes sense

Thank you for your help and time in advance

What is the best way to do the equivalent of assigning a script with an image, by using a checkbox in the cell instead?",11/25/24 23:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1h044gs/assign_a_script_with_a_checkbox_instead_on_an/,Electrical_Fix_8745,"You can't, you instead have to write an onEdit() function that detects the change in the checkbox.

(It's kind of ridiculous we don't have some sort of native ""buttons"" by now, that would allow calling a script and passing parameters.)

Note that checking the checkbox -- and unchecking it -- create additional ""undo"" levels, which is annoying as compared to triggering the script from a drawing/image.

But otoh checkboxes don't require script authorization (on their own), and allow the script to determine where the checkbox is located (for doing things like modifying a row where the checkbox was located).

So in general I prefer checkboxes for most things.

Here are some options for detecting the checkbox change... the standard way and a couple things I've played with.

In all cases I'd recommend highlighting the checkbox ""checked"" state using conditional formatting, so the user gets immediate feedback.   Then uncheck the checkbox in the script.

**Check checkbox location (standard way)**

This is how it's typically done. The sheet name / location of the checkbox is hardcoded in the script, and used to determine if the checkbox is ""special"", as here:

[Timestamper](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E7w71m324qUT-AHxUlHygveiwpMonqhEjFskwSwmI9E/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

This is not ideal because if you move the checkbox somewhere else the script breaks.

**Custom config function**

Sheet calls a function to ""configure"" the script with locations or other info, which are then stored in a document property:

Example here:

[Countdown Timer](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qkciLS2xwsIFAiKZGizSYrDaafmLHM93le2lIJ6hF1Q/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

This isn't great as it clutters up the sheet if you just have a simple thing you're trying to do.  I'm also not sure how much of a performance hit this causes, as the document property must be retrieved each time in onEdit()

**Custom checkbox values**

A custom value for the checkbox allows the script to determine that it's special, and also passes location info to the script.

Example here:

[Image Selector](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kP5trmU9dR97FTOdx7jckMKQvfGM2gS0wh7l1VIuyWk/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

I just started playing with this, and in the example specify Inc\_D4 or Dec\_D4 as the ""checked"" value.

Next time around I think I'll change that to be the ""unchecked"" value so you can see the value in it's unchecked (normal) state, and so you can compare the check state to ""true"" in a more natural way in the sheet (like for conditional formatting).

I'd also probably separate the value by a space, for a more general purpose ""command line"" style.

I think this option has the most promise.  Until Google gives us some real buttons.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1h044gs/assign_a_script_with_a_checkbox_instead_on_an/lz3fyac/,mommasaidmommasaid,2,,,,,,,

I understand versions of this question have been answered previously - I have read through them however as a novice, I can't seem to wrap my head around amending the formulas.

I've also looked on youtube. 

I need the cell colour in column D only to change to orange when 10 to 6 weeks before the date in the cell, then red if before and within 6 weeks of the date. 

The list will grow so applying to the entire column would be ideal. 

As I'm a beginner, I've attached the shared sheet so that you can see what I'm referencing.

googlesheets,Is It Possible To Have Google Sheets SUM Only The Last Numbers In A Column Of Cells?,"Hello, I am seeking help with a Google Sheet that I set up to receive data from WPForms. The form is sending the price and quantity from each entry. It shows up in this format, ""$14.00 x 3"". I was told that WPForms has no way of separating and removing the price from what is sent to Sheets. The client just needs to know the number ordered, but due to the format, SUM doesn't work. Is there any way to disregard everything but the last number when using SUM on a column?

Ideally, I would love to have every column SUMMED at the bottom (there are quite a few columns).

googlesheets,How to Update Functions Using Values from a Key,"hi, I'm pretty new to google sheets so please bear with me. I've tried finding answers before posting, but I'm such a novice I'm having a hard time articulating what I need, so I'm just going to post my project here and hopefully someone can help.

I'm trying to build a game which simulates a group of players swapping their phones' SIM cards at random. the result is that when one player sends a message to another, it arrives at a random phone, purporting to come from a random sender. I want to create a version of this game within Sheets; here is what I have so far:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gHfcyW9yFKDd36Miy0T657d-VKBzuCXQdV71X5xXQ6w/edit?usp=sharing

you'll see that what I have currently is a bunch of sheets that represent each player's phone. on each ""phone"" is a table where they can choose who to send a message to (red), and a table where they can see who they have received messages from (green).

they way I have gone about this so far is very simplistic. the cells in the green table are just told to return text from another cell on another sheet. the cells and sheets to pull from have been entered manually, according to a key on the first sheet (CELL TOWER).

for example, lets say we are Robin, so we use the sheet ""robin."" we want to send a message to Channing, so we type our message in the red table next to ""channing"" (robin!B6). now remember, even though we are Robin and thus have Robin's phone, our SIM card is not our own. according to the CELL TOWER, we have Manny's SIM card. as such, any message we send will appear to come from Manny. because Channing's SIM card is in Zin's phone, when we type our message, it populates in the green table on the ""zin"" sheet, as having come from sender ""manny.""

that cell, zin!B18, has been manually set up to pull from robin!B6, because according to the CELL TOWER, Robin has Manny's SIM card, and Channing, the intended recipient, is on Row 6.

given all this context, here's what I want to achieve: when I fill in the SIM CARD column of the CELL TOWER sheet (column A), I want the functions in the green tables of all sheets to update with the corresponding sheet name for the sender, and cell for the intended recipient. for example, if I update the key for a new game where Zin's phone instead has Hope's SIM card, that green cell would ask for ""robin!B7"". I don't know if this is something that could be achieved by defining variables, or if I need to rebuild with a new approach to make it work. As is, I have to have a human set up the functions before each game, which is obviously not ideal.

any suggestions, feedback, critique, or advice would be greatly appreciated! thanks in advance!",11/24/24 9:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gytlqh/how_to_update_functions_using_values_from_a_key/,bird_furniture,You're totally right.

googlesheets,Iterative countif using lambda with dynamic range,"    =map($R$2:$R2, lambda(rangeX, countif( rangeX ,R2)))

I have this formula which I'm not sure is possible to work. Tried using it with BYROW as well.

The range has a fixed start cell but a dynamic end cell so as it iterates down the rows it should become R2:R3, R2:R4, etc. The criteria would always match the end cell. The idea is to help me identify the first instance of criteria within the column R. I don't know if this is the best approach. 

    =countif( $R$2:$R2 ,R2)

googlesheets,Formula for calculating rent remainders,"First let me explain what you see:

Column A: Month

Column B: Amount of rent that **should be paid** for that month (varies per month).

Column C: **Remainder** of the rent of that specific month, based on the **payments** made.

Column D: Payments of rents; the amount isn't always equal to the sum of rent(s) that should be paid.

Column E: Date of payment (not relevant for my question).

Column F: Total debt until today (special thanks to [adamsmith3567](https://www.reddit.com/user/adamsmith3567/) for helping me with the formula here).

What I am looking for is:

1. A formula for summing up all the **payments** and then redacting the rents, up to the amount of reaching 0. Then, if there is still a **remainder** for a specific month's rent, I want that to show up in Column C, **next to that specific month**. E.g. if the sum of payments covers the months June-August, but only a part of September, I want the remainder amount of September's rent to appear in Column C, next to the September cells (in my case, C5). This is what I have done right now, but manually.
2. A way to automatically fill the cells of columns A&B with color, based on if their rent has been paid (green), semi-paid (brown-ish) or not yet paid (red). I want this to be done based on current date, so no coloring for upcoming months.

I'm hoping for a way to move rows from one sheet over to another sheet (in the same google sheet document) if the number in one cell is above a certain number.

I am trying to use conditional formatting for multiple groups of cells using the ""Custom formula is"" format rule, but I am having trouble getting it to work properly.

For background, the spreadsheet is formatted by groups consisting of 2 columns each (Group 1=B:C, Group 2=D:E, etc.). Row 4 is the sum of the numbers listed below in the respective column, row 3 is the difference of the row 4 values in that group, and row 2 is the group label.

I want the same conditional formatting rules to apply to both rows 2 and 3 for each group of 2 columns based on the value listed in row 3 of that group, so each rule should apply to multiple groups of 2 rows and 2 columns independently (B2:C3, D2:E3, etc.). Red if the value is <0, yellow if =0, green if >0.

The rules I have set at the moment are applying correctly to row 2, but row 3 is not working as intended. It should be affected the same as row 2 of that group. It is seemingly being affected by data it's receiving from row 4? I am also unsure if my ""Apply to range"" setting specifying each group individually is necessary. Can that be condensed somehow?

For a trend line. Open chart settings. Customize tab. Series section. And there is a checkbox you can check for a trend line with options.

For the date. Try a filter function. Like

    =ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SORT(FILTER(A:B,B:B=min(B:B)),1,false),1,2)

I updated this comment.  I made some fake data and made the minimum function slightly more complicated to make it take the most recent date with the lowest weight to account for multiple days with identical weights.

googlesheets,Difference in dates to include start date?,"Posting again, due to forgetting to add body.

Hello, I am trying to make a calculator for total days of business trips. This is just my prototype. I've made each month to have the option of 3 separate trips which provide a total number of days, and I've made a YTD tab to calculate totals for the year. Both flight days need to be counted as a day.

The problem I am having is that using =days or =dateif the difference never includes the start date (or end date). I would like Jan1st - Jan1st to equal 1 day, but it calculates 0... and Jan1st - Jan3rd to equal 3 days but it calculates as 2 and so on...

I input -1 which gave me the desired effect but by doing so, if the fields are left blank it calculates this as 1 which will provide inaccurate totals.  I've thought about doing some kind of hidden column with some kind of ""if 1 make it 0"" kind of thing, but I would also like the option to have a one day trip (jan1-jan1=1day) and this would change it to 0.

I feel like it's one or the other... Please let me know if you have any suggestions, I'm new to this. Thank you!

1. is there a way to generate the pairs in the same cells but separated by a character? i.e. ""Apples , Bananas"" so I can split it up later

2. if that isn't possible without repetition, could I simply make repeating pairs and then eliminate the duplicates somehow?

googlesheets,"using a pair of inputs to find the matching pair out of previous rows, then output another cell from the found row","hi gang, i need help with a ledger that im building. here's what i've got going on. each row represents a payment. each payment is to a specific student loan. so there are 2 identifying pieces of information for each payment/row: payment date, and which loan the payment was made toward. Whenever a new payment to a specific loan is added, the date of the previous payment towards that same loan is added to the row. So we have both identifying pieces of information. What I need help with is using these two pieces of information to search through previous payments to find the payment with the matching loan and date, and then output the corresponding balance after that payment into the new payment as the balance prior to payment.

so essentially the output balance of loan 1 payment 1 becomes the input balance of loan 1 payment 2. i just need help getting the cell to filter through previous transactions and spit out the corresponding balance.

ive attached the data below. to be clear i need the empty green cell to equal the filled green cell, but it has to be by way of the empty green cell finding the row with the date and loan that match with the ""previous payment date"" and loan in the empty green cell's row, out of all rows prior to the green cell. same goes for the gray cells. also, the colors are just used for labeling/to make explaining this easier. i dont need anything colored conditionally or anything so sorry if thats confusing

i guess maybe the best way to explain what i need in google sheets terms would be if i have something in B20 and G20 (the two identifiers mentioned earlier) (row 20 is picked arbitrarily), what do i need to enter into D20 (the balance prior to current payment) to have it search through columns A (payment date)and B (loan name) up to but not including row 20 (the current row), in which there will always be exactly 1 row containing both an A value that equals D20 and a B value that equals B20. lets say its row 17. \*i need google sheets to find this row using the idnetifiers then spit that rows j value into D20 (the balance prior to the currnet payment\*.

also, i dont think this changes anything but this only needs to be expandable downwards from the green and gray cells in column D. the purple cells can stay as they are. thank you in advance to anybody who helps!

this stuff is all very confusing for me to explain so im sure trying to read my confused writing is probably confusing for you too. please let me know if you need clarification on anything

OK. I couldn't get the byrow function to work with the row() function, so i ended up with this formula that i just copied down the entire column.

It looks for the last payment **above** the current installment (hence the row() - 1) and returns the newest installment found (by largest payment date).

    =if(isblank(A20),,
    let(
      rng, indirect(""R4C1:R"" & row()-1 & ""C10"", false),
    
      sr, sort(rng,1,false),

          1, 2
        )
      )
    ))

You can see it also in your demo sheet.

PS. as requested, i start it in row 20 - but there is nothing wrong with starting in the first row, since it gets the starting balance from the Data Entry sheet if no installment is found - or i assumed that the initial balance is kept there?

PS.2 if you do decide to start it in row 4, make sure to adjust the first indirection to refer to R3, since otherwise you will get an illegal range, from row 4 to row 3. :)",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gxj1w4/using_a_pair_of_inputs_to_find_the_matching_pair/lyhjfo2/,One_Organization_810,3,"`=if(isblank(A20),,

Sample Spreadsheet to demonstrate my problem: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XUWnYDrKeaSvGOkAQwbv8my5KNx0QzTPOGVNQgOCw50/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XUWnYDrKeaSvGOkAQwbv8my5KNx0QzTPOGVNQgOCw50/edit?usp=sharing)

So I have an issue I can't solve yet. I'm doing scheduling for an animated TV series and we do this mostly in spreadsheets due to their flexibility. My job is to schedule episodes for each artist so that we get done in time. I've demonstrated the general idea of it in the sample spreadsheet - I have my table above with artists as rows, dates as columns and the episode code and stage of production in the form of a string (EP201\_Shs would mean Episode 1, Season 2, currently in the Shitshots/First pass stage of production). If I write an episode in an artists' cell under a specific date, it means they're scheduled to work that day. In a lower section of the same table, I have rows for each episode, where I want to track how many workdays are scheduled for it by counting the cells with the corresponding episode code in the rows above.

Currently, it works with the formula I've used in the sample spreadhseet, but I have to manually add the formula to each cell which is not great. I'd rather have an arrayformula kind of solution where I enter the formula once at the beginning of the row and it automatically expands into every cell (in an effort to idiot proof the spreadsheet). Unfortunately I already used an arrayformula to get the count of each episode, and nesting arrayformulas doesn't seem to work.

Is there a way to get my desired result in a way that automatically fills in each cell?",11/22/24 4:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gx582d/is_there_a_way_to_nest_arrayformulas/,Mikomics,"    =byrow(A8:A,lambda(y,if(y="""",,BYCOL(C1:G4,LAMBDA(x,if(counta(ifna(FILTER(x,LEFT(x,5)=y)))=0,, counta(ifna(FILTER(x,LEFT(x,5)=y)))))))))

googlesheets,Can't figure out how to click a box and copy the row it's on from another sheet.,"Been trying different methods for the past few days but can't even get the basics from googling anymore. Really feeling let down by the search engine these past few years. Have also tried chatGPT, but to no avail. Sorry to ask y'all and waste time but thanks for reading and helping.

The issue:

Need to check a box \[in a column of boxes\], and OnEdit if that box is checked, copy that row over from another sheet to reset that row to default.  
The checkboxes are in groups, so the first ten might be in column AA, 11-20 might be in column U, etc. This has implications for OnEdit being able to make sure it's looking at the right cells.

WhatI 've tried:

Honestly, just trying to get the pseudocode in my head out onto paper.

googlesheets,Half of a simple script to reset a workbook not working,"Hello all. I have been beating my head against what should be a super easy script, but I cannot get half of  it to work.

I have a spreadsheet with two sheets. The first is a list of students, their student ID #s, a column with checkboxes if their parents authorize their absence, and a second column that reads TRUE if they are absent for a school reason (field trip, club, sports, etc). The second is where information about school-related absences is entered. Whenever I get an email with a list of students to be excused for some legit event, I add their student ID (which automatically fills in their name), the date that they are excused, and what period they will be absent for if it is less than the full day.

The fifth column of this second sheet checks to see if any of the dates in the list are today, and if they are changes the appropriate cell in row C on sheet1 to indicate that the student is going to be absent. The sixth column checks to see if any of the dates in the list are in the past, and fills the appropriate cell in row F with TRUE if that is the case.

Then I wrote a script that I run at the end of each day to reset the workbook. Any parental authorization checkmarks are deleted. Up to this point everything works fine.

The other half of the script does nothing. What I am trying to do is check column F for any TRUE cells (which would mean that the date in that row is in the past), and if F is TRUE, erase the student ID (Column A) (which automatically erases the name), the period cell (column D), and the date cell (Column C) for that row.

What am I missing? The script doesn't report any problems. When I try debugging it the for loop works (i comes back as 31). I don't know what I am doing wrong.

Each person is a dropdown on all the sheets, so my anticipated behavior is that when Michele selects the Golden Retriever, I would select her name from the dropdown and then have that cell move over to Team Michele on the main sheet/table.

  
Maybe I need to reorganize this, but any help would be appreciated!

googlesheets,How can I censor Names and replace certain characters with *,"Hi, I have two columns where column A has the first name and column B has the last name. I want to censor the names when I concatenate them in one cell.

Currently, i use this formula =concatenate(A2,"" "",left(B2,2),""\*"","""")

But I feel like this can be improved. Would it be possible to create a formula in column C that could produce the text below?

Rules:

(1) First name will not be censored.

(2) If there is a second name, and the 2nd name has 1-4 characters, then 3rd and 4th character will be replaced with \*. If the 2nd name has 5 characters, 3rd and 4th characters will be replaced with \* and last 5th character will be shown. If the 2nd name has more than 5 characters, only the first two and last two characters will be shown

(3) If the last name has 1-4 characters, then 3rd and 4th character will be replaced with \*. If the last name has 5 characters, 3rd and 4th characters will be replaced with \* and last 5th character will be shown. If the last name has more than 5 characters, only first two and last two characters will be shown.

(4) If last name has two names separated with a space, they will be censored same in rule 3.

Hi, I have a problem with the formatting of a spreadsheet I use to track the total durations of the calls I make at work. I have them formatted in an hours:minutes way, and then added up at the top. The problem is that once I reached a total of 24 hours, it automatically changed to counting days. This messes with some other of my formulas since I need to know the total number of hours I was in calls, so I need it to stay in hours (eg saying 26:whateverminutes instead of 01:02:minutes).

I have been fighting the formatting to no avail. Is there a way to fix this?

Just change the starting date and the number of rows you want (the 20).  If you want them away from the formula then you can always copy the whole range then and 'paste special, values only' in another location.

googlesheets,Dropdowns without duplicates or errors,"I want to be able to use data validation to let people each rank a group of candidates from first to last.

googlesheets,"Vlookup formula to compare two lists, showing the variances. Lists aren't identical  ","Hello,

Hopefully this is very straight forward, I'm just a googlesheets noob. 

I'm doing a stocktake and want to compare two lists, one before the stocktake and one after. It isn't going to be as easy as having them side by side and filtering alphabetically as we often find products during stocktake, so the list goes out of sync (and there's 1000s of products)

It’s simpler to show the entire list, but you can then use the builtin filter tool (the icon that looks like a funnel on the tool bar) to see only items with a variance. To pull the entire (unique) list of products in K3, you’d use: `=UNIQUE(TOCOL({A3:A,F3:F},true))`

Then for the difference between stock (M3) you’d use: `=Byrow(K3:K, lambda(x, if(isblank(x),, let(green, xlookup(x,A:A,C:C,0,0), yellow, xlookup(x,F:F,H:H,0,0), yellow-green))))` and you can use a similar formula in N3 to get the difference in prices. *I wasn’t sure which direction the subtraction should go for your records, so swap the colors in the subtraction at the end of the formula if needed.*

Right now I’m creating a maintenance tracker for my place of work. I’m looking to create a “days since last maintenance” tracker, where data from the main table will be used to calculate how many days have passed since the last time a specific machine was serviced.

Right now, my main problem is this: I can use the TODAY function to get today’s date in the cell, but when it comes to subtracting the date of the last maintenance from that date, I’m having trouble figuring out how to get the cell to read the date of the most recent maintenance rather than a fixed set of three cells. Is it possible for sheets to read the sheet, locate which date is the most recent for each machine (each one has a special code in the table), and enter those values into the formula automatically?

Replace your two formulas in the 2nd row with these and drag down.  Your syntax was just incorrect for the first one and it's corrected.  IFS evaluates in order so it should work as intended now taking a 'mainly' condition if any is >0.75 and then if not picking a 'moderately' condition.

The second formula just looks at all 3 values and picks the second highest returning the category.  If it returns a zero as the second highest is shows the ""none"" flag.

As an aside, I don't see a reason to make these dropdowns as if you accidentally change one manually it will override and delete the formula.

There isn't really a way to make this ""auto-fillable"".  But you can use the formula to create all the names and then copy-paste as above.  Place in first cell; can change the 20 to however many rows you want.  It will create a column with each name in a cell.

If you want the names separated from the formula, just copy and 'paste special, values only' after letting the formula create the names.

No, it is not possible. You can, however, have a column containing a dropdown list of the channel they found your website, and another column to show the list of the past customer in case the 'customer referral' was chosen.

Unfortunately, you can't hide the dropdown arrow of the second column for the other options.

I want to create a Google spreadsheet that allows me to perform the calculations in the image, let me explain:

But it gives me an error, could you help me? I am really a beginner.",11/17/24 10:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gthns8/conditional_formula_for_calculating_hydration/,iza001davd,"Welcome to Sheets!

Your formula seemed to work for me, but I would suggest instead using IFS for clarity.  And you can get fancy with the formatting to make it even more clear.

Be careful about your comparisons, you said ""less than 9.9"" and ""10 or more"" which leaves out all the values >= 9.9 and < 10

If someone enters an unexpected value like 9.95, or a formula returns that and is fed into your equation, it may fall through the cracks or return an unexpected value.

Finally, you can get rid of some of those parentheses due to mathematical order of operations.

So all cleaned up, reordered, readable, and comparing in ascending order where nothing falls through the cracks...

    =IFS(A2<10, A2*100,
         A2<20, A2*50 + 1000,
         true,  A2*20 + 1500)

The last row **true** is a catch-all for anything that didn't match the previous comparisons.

Your description said ""if it weighs between 20 and 30 kg"", so if you wanted to enforce that you could change the last row to < 30 or whatever, and then add a separate catchall error message.

Finally, you might also want to assign a variable (I used `kg` here) to use in place of A2 for further readability, especially in more complex functions with multiple inputs.

It is also more easily maintained, because if you later want to change the cell you are referencing, you only have to do it in one place.

     ifs(kg<10, kg*100,

googlesheets,Adding a metric to an established spreadsheet by primary key,[deleted],11/16/24 0:34,,deleted,"u/-discostu- XLOOKUP will allow you to bring over data by a unique lookup key (like the student id number)

Editing to add: let’s say the majors are on a second sheet (tab) called “Majors” in the same spreadsheet (file), and the student id numbers are in column A and majors in column B. Assuming the student ID numbers in your main sheet are in column A, with the data starting in row 2, you can blend them with the existing data using: `=XLOOKUP(A2,Majors!A:A,Majors!B:B,,0)` and drag it down the column to populate the majors for each student.

*Alternatively, you can use `=BYROW(A2:A, LAMBDA(id,IF(ISBLANK(id),,XLOOKUP(id,Majors!A:A,Majors!B:B,,0))))` in the first cell you want the major to populate, and it will fill the entire column with the single formula.*

googlesheets,Many-to-many lookup formula in header arrayformula,"I have data on two sheets, tracking music compositions on one and the performances of those compositions on the second. I've given each row in each sheet a unique ID. I'm trying to use a formula on the first sheet to have a comma-separated list of performances that included a particular composition. Of course, each composition could be performed more than once, and each performance could include multiple compositions, so it's a many-to-many relationship.

[The table of Performances. Each performance has a unique ID and references each of the Compositions that were performed in that performance.](https://preview.redd.it/eh9fmz5r2b1e1.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701d46dabfa45c55fed7b67f6bfed363513a4d0)

If I use `FILTER()`, I can search for all the performances containing a reference to a particular composition, which will return an array of Performance IDs. I can then use `TEXTJOIN()` to concatenate them into a single cell. I used this formula, and it works great:

`=IF(ISBLANK(A2),,IFERROR(TEXTJOIN("", "", TRUE, FILTER(Performances!A$2:A,SEARCH(A2,Performances!C$2:C))),))`

[If I use a FILTER\(\) formula and copy it down the whole column, it works great. Column T shows the expected values in raw plain text, just to check my work as I'm building the formula.](https://preview.redd.it/irp2chgi5b1e1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=8766af15409d7e1d24918d9bdadc2f0067efeafa)

In an effort to keep my sheet clean, I want to use the `ARRAYFORMULA({""Header"";FORMULA()})` trick to house the formula in Row 1 and have it populate the data without me needing to copy the formula down every time I add more data to the sheet. For example, something like this:

`=ARRAYFORMULA({""Performances Array"";IF(ISBLANK(A$2:A),,IFERROR(TEXTJOIN("", "", TRUE, FILTER(Performances!A$2:A,SEARCH(A2,Performances!C$2:C))),))})`

If I change the value within `ISBLANK()` to a range, as shown here, it does copy the formula down the whole sheet as expected. But I'm having trouble with the `FILTER()` now. If I don't change the first value of the `SEARCH()` to a range, then of course it only searches the one cell, so returns the same value all the way down the column. But if I *do* change it to a range, then the `FILTER()` throws an error: ""FILTER has mismatched range sizes. Expected row count: 50. column count: 1. Actual row count: 59, column count: 1.""

So, my question: is there a way to put a `FILTER()` inside an `ARRAYFORMULA()` so that the `FILTER()` gets copied down like this, but substitutes in the relevant search criteria for that row? Or are there any other ways to achieve what I'm trying to do here?

For context, I'm brand-new today to both `ARRAYFORMULA()` and `FILTER()`, and I've never used `QUERY()` in case that comes up.",11/16/24 12:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gsu47h/manytomany_lookup_formula_in_header_arrayformula/,ianacook,"u/ianacook You’re so close!

googlesheets,Sequenced SUMIF Formula,"Hello, a beginner sheets/excel person here and I'm trying to do something that seems a bit too complex for me and I'm having trouble figuring it out.

What I'm trying to do is have a cell SUM the values in column D until a row where column F has ""Yes"" and repeat as a sequence. For example in my image, I would like to have a cell show the sum amount from D4 onwards until another instance similar to cell F3 occurs where the value is ""Yes"". Then I want the cell to clear the SUM and start over again, so on so fourth.

I hope I explained that well, happy to explain further if needed.

Decide which way cash flow should be positive, i.e. from the store's or customer's perspective, and make one of those columns negative numbers.  That way the numbers ""tell the story"" and can all be summed together, and even in the same column for a more compact display if you want.

Red square = Q1.

\- the formulas I have in these cells I have currently been dragging down each row.

Any advice on how to make this an infinite formula that doesn't rely on me copying downwards? (just hoping for a cleaner sheet)

Green square = Q 2

the conditional formatting I have in that row is an example of a CF to highlight the last empty row to be a quick visual reference point of where to enter the next data set.

    CF Rule:

Couple things.  Edited to change a few things.   Now, the first formula doesn't add a total until all 3 columns are filled.  This allows the CF rule to key off the B column and not advance which row is highlighted until all 3 columns (C:E) are filled and a new total is added; this means it should direct you to fill in the blanks on that row until it's full.

Second formula.  I think I hit the best solution of what I had before.  It now fills in all boxes up to the last row with any value in it (for columns C:E or G:Q).  FYI, the total in your example tab is incorrect b/c it wasn't adding shares from the Q column (unless that was intentional.)

I also added a CF rule for the dates in column A that highlights any date in January instead of your manually colored Januaries.

googlesheets,I don't know how to filter cells by condition.,"<I like documenting progress of games on sheets and this one for some reason has me very much stumped.

I have 3 columns that are the main point of this problem. I want to hide cells (rows would work fine too) to filter out names of characters that I don't want to use for a sacrificially.

In column A I have all the characters, in column C I have the characters I haven't unlocked yet and in column D I have characters that I use in battle units.  
I'd like to filter the characters from columns C and D to be the only ones showing in Column A so I can use it as reference to not sacrifice those characters.  
If possible to automate it using a function would be preferred. The automation would just be for changes in columns C or D to then be updated to Column A.

here is a screenshot to give a bit of the context. I've tried using different formulas with and without the filter button but I haven't gotten it to work.

googlesheets,Conditional Drop Down List issues (and a more general question) ,"Hello, I'm not new to Sheets, but I'm not very good at it. I usually rely on brute force rather than exploiting formulas, because I don't have a good grasp of logic commands and haven't taken the time to learn. I'm trying to change that, however. I was using ChatGPT to troubleshoot what I'm currently working on, but so far it has been fairly useless. 

What I am trying to accomplish right now, is make it so that after I define my muscle group from the C2 dropdown, D2 dropdown automatically populates with a list of exercises from the existing sheet. I defined the ranges to make it easy to select, but so far have run into error / invalid range messages when I tried using an ""INDIRECT"" function as ChatGPT directed. Any help in making a conditional dropdown would be fantastic. 

My long term goal is to be able to easily graph my total volume / improvement / average pound per rep delta, by not only muscle groups, but individual exercises. For example, to be able to just enter ""Biceps"" and get a sum of training volume for **all** bicep exercises (sets x reps x weight), or a graph showing volume over time; or to be able to look at just Bicep curls and see the same data. And when I'm looking at my overall volume, to be able to see what percentage per week is arms vs back vs legs, etc. I haven't built out this sheet enough since I just started, but I'll include my old data tracker from my college days (3rd and 4th picture) to show what I ended up with - it was very bulky and manual, and I ultimately gave up on trying to get any other data out of it apart from just the Big 3 exercises (Bench, Deadlift, Squat) since everything else was uncategorized when I started. 

So I'm trying to learn my lesson from the first time I did this years ago, and **start** with an organized spreadsheet conducive to producing the outputs that I want in 2, 4, 6, 12 months, etc; but the limits of my ignorance are as boundless as this table: so please and thank you for any and all help, thoughts, etc! 

P.S.: these are *not* my final aesthetics and I would like not to be judged by them please, just my personal flaws and intellectual shortcomings is fine.

The thing is, with spreadsheets, you need to have an efficient way to structure your data that would work seamlessly with the way spreadsheets is designed, while having an easy way to enter your data.

There's a ""natural"" order of data that works well with the various functions google sheets provides. Usually I'd like to have three separate sheets each with a unique role.

**1. Data entry sheet**

Here you can get away with structuring your dates in descending order, meaning today is always on top. This way you can avoid scrolling 800 rows, but to be honest you don't need to scroll even if your data is in ascending order because you can just use ctrl+down arrow to jump down to the lowest populated cell.

If you prefer to have it in descending order, this is where you do it.

Usually I recommend google forms for data entry, but in your case I think entering data directly is a good option. You could still do it with google forms if you prefer. That way you could do it without your physical notebook and log the data, exercise after exercise, through your phone, also google forms automatically adds a timestamp, which can be used later to organize your data by date.

Important, make sure to format your Data Entry Sheet as a table. Tables have quality of life features that make everything simpler, like a plus icon appearing when you hover over the row numbers that lets you quickly insert a new row.

I suggest using this structure:  
Date | Session # | Group | Muscle | Exercise | Reps | Weight

**2. Calculations sheet**

Here it's best if you order you data with descending dates, meaning today is always on the bottom. Perform all your calculations here. This sheet is bound to get ugly and cluttered, so don't worry about aesthetics because you will get a chance to display your data nicely in the third sheet.

**3. Dashboard**

Here you organize everything neatly and aesthetically. Have your charts and scorecards here. Display data per month, sums, averages - whatever you need.

It takes your rent date, hard-coded in the formula, and just multiplies the difference of today from that day by $10.  There are other more complicated options of course like app scripts.  But this will provide you a simple count for any rent day up to ""today"".  You could also swap out the DATEVALUE portion for a date in another cell and just reference the cell like B1.

To expand, sheets treats dates as integers with 1 being equal to 1 day.  So this just subtracts the integer of today minus one from a few days ago and multiplies by 10.

Edit.  Tweaked formula to cap at $300 per the post.  This will show the actual amount up to 300, and if over that, just show 300.  It also moves the hard-coded date to the front so you only have to edit it in one place.

I am trying to create a specific movie dataset from TMDB and/or OMDB APIs, for my movie diary - hobby web project (and learn some tech stuff along the way :)    - So, I connected API to Google sheets (API connector) 

\- **PROBLEM**: With TMDB API search response - I don't get all needed info columns for the movie (missing: director, cast ...)

**- QUESTION:** how to add missing columns for each row (movie)  fill in missing data in specific cells  -  using parts of the single movie API response (from either TMDB API, or another one,  OMDB API)?

ILLUSTRATION - how to pull from API to fill in respective missing cells in last column?

|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|123478|Godfather|1972|\*\* MISSING \*\*|
|389256|Inception|2012|\*\* MISSING \*\*|
|123694|Forrest Gump|1991|\*\* MISSING \*\*|

\- using either TMDB API for single movie, or another OMDB API  ?  
(that also has this missing data - for one single movie only, but more simple structured

// - api call example: [http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=\[123abcwhatever\]](http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=[123abcwhatever]) )  
(3896198= specific movie ID)



\*\*\*  
Details for better understanding:  TMDB API has 2 methods: 

**1 - /discover/movie**   \-  you get **response with multiple movies** = multiple rows (for. ex I search eng. movies  from 2020-2024) 

\- so I got sheet with my dataset now - but **missing some data (columns) - director, cast, trailer ...**

// - example: [https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?language=en-US&primary\_release\_year.gte=2020&primary\_release\_year.lte=2024](https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?language=en-US&primary_release_year.gte=2020&primary_release_year.lte=2024)

  
**2 - single movie** \- you get all data, included the mentioned missing columns   
\- but for **one movie only (one row)** \- and too much details (columns) 

// - example: [https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/343611?&append\_to\_response=credits](https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/343611?&append_to_response=credits)

I have it set to where I can select multiple for one cell. So I could have one with ""Diag, Brakes, LOF"" selected, one with just ""Brakes"", or any combo of the tags I've created. 

What I am trying to do is create a pie chart so I can easily see the percentages of each category I am doing. 

The issue I'm running into is that when I create a pie chart and select the appropriate range of cells, it shows one slice for each cell, not for each label. Meaning, if one repair is labeled ""Diag, Brakes"" and another is labeled just ""Brakes"", each of those gets their own slice on the pie chart. I would prefer for it to show me the percentages of the labels only. As in, how many were tagged with ""Brakes"" or ""Diag"" irrespective of if multiple selections were made in a cell.

googlesheets,Chart with multiple series from a single range where points are labeled by another column?,"I have a spreadsheet that tracks my running best times for various fixed distances.

I'd really like to create a single chart that shows a separate line for each distance with the trend by date.  But since charts only do that if you have a separate series for each data set it seems I must either create a separate column for each distance like 1K time, 5K time, etc. or split all my data into multiple spreadsheets and have a separate chart for each distance which isn't what I wanted. And splitting time over multiple columns doesn't work either because then you get items in each series with no value.

I've also tried populating additional sheets per distance eg. running 1K, running 5K, etc. which look the same as the above but are selecting data from the sheet above with something like `=filter(running!A2:F999,running!B2:B999=""1K"")` but I can't figure out how to combine the data from those separate sheets into a single chart - since it would be an x-y plot I can't seem to have multiple ranges for x-axis data.

Ok.  I was rushed when looking at this before.  I didn't notice what you wanted for the start days.  Assuming it's always partway through the week to finish out the week that starts with the date above; i figured out a way to calculate the start and end dates by having a formula scan over to find the first column with a number then calculate the date based on that number of days around the top date.

For your examples it matches what your test tab shows as the desired outcome.  (see my tab again for the updated formulas; I also converted both columns to single BYROW formulas at the top).

This is for calculating the start date which works to figure out which date is the start day based on how many days are in the first filled box for that week.

    =BYROW(B2:B,lambda(y,IF(y="""",,INDIRECT(ADDRESS(1,INDEX(MIN(IF(INDIRECT(""F""&row(y)&"":""&row(y))<>"""",COLUMN(INDIRECT(""F""&row(y)&"":""&row(y)))))),4))+5-INDIRECT(ADDRESS(row(y),INDEX(MIN(IF(INDIRECT(""F""&row(y)&"":""&row(y))<>"""",COLUMN(INDIRECT(""F""&row(y)&"":""&row(y)))))),4)))))

And this one for the end date after the start date.  All calculated values are now automatic and match your test tab.

    =BYROW(C2:C,lambda(x,if(x="""",,WORKDAY(x,SUM(INDIRECT(""F""&ROW(x)&"":N""&row(x)))-1))))

googlesheets,How to efficiently copy ranges of spreadsheet with internal absolute/mixed references?,"Hello! So at a high level, I understand that copying absolute reference will no change them (it's the whole point of it being absolute), however, I think that sometimes when you copy a whole \_range\_ of formulas, the absolute references to cells ***in the copied range*** should be updated relatively upon copy, while staying absolute references.

To make more sense with an example:

It's a simple table with 2 numbers (A2:A3), their total (A4), and percentages (B2:B3), calculated using absolute reference to $A$4

||A|B|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Count|Percentage|
|2|10|20%|
|3|40|80%|
|4|50||

If I copy the whole range A1:B4 to say C1:D4, my expected behavior is that the denominator in the percentages should reference $C$4, so that if I update my new table, the percentages are correct.

Today, D2 will be ""=C2/$A$2"", which is incorrect.

I can make all percentage formulas be relative, but then if I insert a new row I'll have to manually update each new percentage formula.

Does anyone else have this problem? How do you resolve it?",11/09/24 17:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gnmy8n/how_to_efficiently_copy_ranges_of_spreadsheet/,oyiyo,"I feel your nuanced pain.

The count total (A4) only has to be specified once, so a relative reference is fine. It becomes sort of a ""local absolute"" reference like you were looking for, because it doesn't adjust for each lambda call.

googlesheets,Help to simplify endless countif formula,"Hello the internet,

I don't know what I'm doing. So far what I've done has been a combination of winging it and hours of searching Google Sheets forums for answers, but this is too difficult. Any explanation would need to be super simplified because, as mentioned, I don't know what I'm doing.

Some screenshots:

https://preview.redd.it/zxsjljpm6pzd1.png?width=2792&format=png&auto=webp&s=0faf289916d6fd4dbb4476d070d18c536ea84547

The data is pulled from the rota, as seen here (one table for each day of the week, all on the same page):

https://preview.redd.it/saw2x8s57pzd1.png?width=2872&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6a382a1bda8a9da7aaa64f0c4c54e0d04318bbc

What I would like to happen is for the ""sessions this week"" column to be populated by looking at all time slots across the week, searching for the person's name (as per the ""name"" column, like F57 in the screenshot ""person 3"") and then counting only if ""Attended"" or ""Cancelled WITHOUT Notice"" is selected from the dropdown.

As you can see from the first screenshot, I have figured out one way to do it which was an absolute struggle, involving individually typing out 70+ lines of COUNTIF criteria. It points to each individual time slot on each day of the week and separately asks if it's got the name in the cell (F57) and either ""attended"" or ""cancelled without notice"" in the adjacent cell. Massive faff.

Is there a way I can do a COUNTIF with two criteria (ie. the correct name AND one of the two dropdown options) AND apply it to multiple different ranges? Or a different way altogether? I've read about array formulas but no idea what they are. Sorry for my cluelessness!

Here (?I think) is a sample sheet

googlesheets,Filling out a table with Irregular? Data,"I aspire to run a round-robin tournament with every character in Sparking! Zero, which means I'm going to set up and watch 16471 matches and record who wins. I used some site to generate a list of matches by typing in all the character names, as well as a table of every matchup to be filled out with Win/Loss and tally the wins. I've copied those to a google sheet which I have linked below. By far the easiest and least prone to error way for me to actually fill out this data as I run matches is to simply write ""Win""/""Loss"" next to each match in the list and have the table fill itself in, but I'm at a loss for how to get each cell in the 182x182 grid to know where it's supposed to be looking. My best effort was to have each one check the far left of its own row and the top of its own column against the relevant cells on the second sheet, but the only way I could figure out how to do that would be by writing thousands of IF statement in a line, which is far worse than just doing everything manually. Also, every time I type Win or Loss it actually has to fill out two spaces, one for A vs B and the other for B vs A with the opposite result.

Is there a better way to populate this huge table than doing it manually? Would it be entirely unreasonable to ask all 32000 cells to poll another 32000 cells to find a pair that matches them? Am I going about this all wrong?

2. If the individual then enters a project on their own sheet on row 3, using the FILTER function would presumably overwrite row 3 of the overview sheet? Or do the permissions of the overview sheet (only I have editing access) prevent this?

Thanks in advance :)

If you mean like a ""team list"", alternatively you could have an area on each individual sheet for anyone to enter a new project(s).

Then make a ""Consolidated Active Projects"" table (on its own sheet) that pulls relevant (e.g. active) projects from your main list, as well as from everyone's individual's sheet.   Individual projects could be automatically marked as ""Pending approval"" or something if needed.

And use then use that Consolidated table for all of your query formulas across the whole team.

The end result being that that anyone can create a project on their own page that immediately shows up everywhere relevant, without having to wait for you to add it to a master list.

And unlike a shared team list, individuals can't accidentally screw up somebody else's stuff. Worst case they just screw up their own.

Then you could move new projects from individual pages to your main list. Or, eventually automate some of that process with apps script.

\---------

Depending on how many team members you have, you could have (yet another) tab that displays ONLY the team members new project requests, so you can quickly see your ""to do"" list of projects to approve.

And/or generate a message on your main page that says you have projects waiting to approve.

\----------

Your sheet organization looks basically fine, one caution is that allowing multiple selections in a dropdown makes it significantly more annoying to do some types of filtering / queries / calculations.

Ideally you have one value per cell, though if you need the capability of for example assigning multiple names to a task (which is what I'm guessing the ACP is for), it might be a lesser of evils kind of thing.

(This is another situation where a real database would be useful, with linked tables.)

\----------

It's also not clear what kind of data you are planning for users to add on their individual pages, where it's entered, if it's linked to specific projects, or if it needs to be retained longer-term.

That's likely where you'll run into some tricky bits compared to a real database and will want to plan how to best work around.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gn9vxm/crosslink_cell_duplication_between_sheets/lwa36bi/,mommasaidmommasaid,1,,,,,,,

googlesheets,Blank cell when using checkboxes in a formula,"Hello, 

I've been struggling with this for longer than I'd like to admit. I've assigned values to cells when they're checked. I've got 3 different categories with 3 options each, -1(red), 0(yellow), 1(green). Only one of each category will ever be selected at a time. I then add up each row, K3, for a total between -3 and 3. Often times 0 is the total. The challenge I'm having is getting 0 to show when it's the total, but the cell to be blank when nothing is selected. Everything I've tried has either resulted in 0 being shown both when nothing is selected and when the sum is 0, or the cell being blank both when nothing is selected and when the sum is zero.

I think I got something going that'll work. I highlighted the formulas in colors, basically two parts:

  
1) Calculate the opponent win rates - I assume it is taking the ""won against"" columns and averaging the win rates of those. If that isn't the case, please let me know! I went and did it all in one, sorry it is a bit lengthy. The base of it is the QUERY function that pulls the win percentages based on the team IDs. This is done via BYROW(TRANSPOSE(J2:P2),LAMBDA(x,IF(ISBLANK(x),,XLOOKUP(x,$A:$A,$G:$G,))))

Then the query statement takes the average of these teams and excludes null / the label. 

    =IFERROR(QUERY(BYROW(TRANSPOSE(J2:P2),LAMBDA(x,IF(ISBLANK(x),,XLOOKUP(x,$A:$A,$G:$G,)))),""SELECT AVG(Col1) WHERE Col1 IS NOT NULL LABEL AVG(Col1) ''"",0),)

  
2) Adjusted your win rate to be by row. Just makes it so you don't need to pull it down as you go and accounts for blank rows.  

The ""OPW"" is ""opponent win rate"", and ""TWR"" is ""team win rate"":

    =MAP(Q2:Q,G2:G,LAMBDA(OPW,TWR,IF(ISBLANK(OPW),,((TWR*0.5)+(OPW*0.5)))))

  
Note right now it only accounts for the J-P for games and requires the wins there, if there may be more games, that range in the first one will need to be adjusted (The **J2:P2** range**)**

I'd like to have my formula increase the row number of what it is referencing by 4 for each single square I copy it down. For example, B3 refers to 'Costs of Cardinal Directions'!B2, then B4 refers to refers to 'Costs of Cardinal Directions'!B6, B5-> 'Costs of Cardinal Directions'!B10, etc.

I tried simply manually inputting it three times, and then dragging those but Google Sheets increased each of the three by one individually.. So I got B2, B6, B10, B3, B5, B11, etc.

I also tried VLOOKUP, using this formula: =VLOOKUP(""North"",'Costs of Cardinal Directions'!$B$2:$C$53,2,TRUE) but as North it repeated multiple times it gets stuck on the first instance of it.

If I could have VLOOKUP alter what cells it looked at by 4 as I dragged it down this would make it work, but that runs into the same problem of changing a reference by 4 for each square moved.

I know I could just drag the formula 'Costs of Cardinal Directions'!B2 down super far and delete all of the unwanted rows after, but this seems like a terribly clunky solution.

I'd like to have my formula increase the row number of what it is referencing by 4 for each single square I copy it down. For example, B3 refers to 'Costs of Cardinal Directions'!B2, then B4 refers to refers to 'Costs of Cardinal Directions'!B6, B5-> 'Costs of Cardinal Directions'!B10, etc.

I tried simply manually inputting it three times, and then dragging those but Google Sheets increased each of the three by one individually.. So I got B2, B6, B10, B3, B5, B11, etc.

I also tried VLOOKUP, using this formula: =VLOOKUP(""North"",'Costs of Cardinal Directions'!$B$2:$C$53,2,TRUE) but as North it repeated multiple times it gets stuck on the first instance of it.

If I could have VLOOKUP alter what cells it looked at by 4 as I dragged it down this would make it work, but that runs into the same problem of changing a reference by 4 for each square moved.

I know I could just drag the formula 'Costs of Cardinal Directions'!B2 down super far and delete all of the unwanted rows after, but this seems like a terribly clunky solution.

Thank you in advance for any help! I'm going to need to apply this to a lot of data, so if I can avoid doing it manually it will save me a lot of time.",11/07/24 9:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1glt24y/having_a_formula_change_what_cell_it_is/,ttant,"You could solve this with OFFSET()

I have a sheet with a long list of names and numbers, and then a second smaller list of just names underneath. I currently have a formula that compares both lists and puts a star next to any names on the top list that appear on the bottom list as well. I would like to add an extra formula that takes the number attached to the top name, and takes the number to the bottom list for the duplicate name.

For Example, the top list has a star next to James since it appears on both, but I would like for the bottom list to have a 6 next to it like on the top list. Does anyone have a formula that could work for this?

googlesheets,Help with a script to copy and pasta data into a list,"I love a good spreadsheet but I have never written a script before and I think that's the only way to accomplish what I want to do here.

For context: I run a business that accepts cash, staff do safe drops with a ticket that has the total cash value of the safe drop on it. I have to check safedrop values, and create a deposit slip for the bank that has totals of each value of bill.

Currently, I count the money in the safedrop and verify the value, then sort the bills into piles ($5 bills, $10 bills, etc, I'm in Canada so there's no $1 bills on purpose) then I count those piles and manually enter the total number of each denomination into my deposit slip. My issue is that sometimes I end up recounting safedrops a few times because my mental math that day is lacking, and I hate having to count everything twice to do the deposit slip after.

What I want to do:

I have a sheet where I enter in the number of each bill and it spits out the value of the safedrop for me, I do this in the deposit slip already so I just copied it over into the safedrop slip sheet, which I can verify against the safedrop ticket. If they don't match I do a recount. I've got this done on the ""Safe Drop Slips"" sheet.

At this point, I have a count of how many bills of each denomination in that safedrop (column A) so I want to copy those values into a list on my ""Totals"" sheet and clear my safedrop counting sheet to do the next safedrop, then repeat until all my safedrops are counted and I'll end up with a list of all my counted bills on the ""Totals"" sheet. Then it seems to me like a simple function on my deposit slip sheet can add up how many of each bill I just counted.

It doesn't have to be pretty I just want to save myself some time and human error in my counting and math.

Attached screenshots of my 3 sheets I'm trying to use here.

A bit of data in there to show what I'm doing.

Thanks for any help!

Put this into cell (what appears to be C2.  See this test sheet with it operating (IDLookup tab).  

I saw you wanted all names in the formula.  That isn't very resilient coding.  In this example you create a table of the names and ID numbers, this allows you to add and remove people as needed without changing the formula itself.  The table can even be on another tab and you reference it in the formula.

googlesheets,Any way to auto-sort by date & time? ,"Hi, I have any appointment sheet because I'm a sicky girl with bad genes. It used to be just my medical appointments but it was so useful that now it has all of my family's appointments including stuff like when the pest control guy is dropping by, so, I've had to make some updates to the sheet in the past couple of years. (I make one per year.) Given that 2024 has been a trainwreck of a year, I wanted to auto-sort dates and times on the 2025 sheet if at all possible to make things go a little smoother. Ideally, I'd like it to sort by date --> then time of day.

This is a mockup of the sheet I would normally use, but with otherwise fake info, mostly. I deliberately put some of the dates out of order here, but I normally just manually put them in order.

I'm not super experienced with Google Sheets and the experience I do have is mostly piecing stuff together for personal use like my appointment calendar or to do bills. So feel free to talk to me like I'm 6, because I don't actually know what I'm doing. Again, sorting by date first, then by time of day would be most ideal. A-Z/1-9 chronological order, of course.

I know that if things auto-sort like I'm suggesting, that'll mean it moves as I put in the date, which could be super duper annoying while I'm in the middle of putting in a bunch of appointments at the doctor's office. In the past I got around annoying stuff like this with other sheets I've made by having a reference sheet, but I like barely remember how to do this. So any advice is welcome.",11/07/24 0:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gljyaq/any_way_to_autosort_by_date_time/,Phoenix_Muses,"u/Phoenix_Muses Thanks! This makes it much clearer :)

If everything (the entry of appointments and the sorted viewing) is in the same sheet, you won’t be able to use a formula to do the sort. Your first option would be to sort manually (which is fairly quick!) via the built in sort/filter tools, accessible via the funnel-looking icon on the toolbar.

The second option is a bit less manual: you can record a macro of the sorting action described above. Then attach that macro to a button so the sort (the way you recorded it) happens when you click the button. This is sort of like a scripts-lite method as you’ll be using a script but won’t need to write it!

The third option with your current setup is more automatic but also more complex: write a script to run the sort with an onEdit trigger. Depending on how you write the script, you may run into the scenario you describe where the row shifts as you’re still editing it.

The hidden fourth option here is to have a second sheet (tab) for the sorted viewing of your appointments. This could be done via a simple formula that will always automatically maintain the sort you prefer. Additionally, because you’d be entering the appointments on one sheet (not where the sort is happening), your rows won’t shift on you as you add or edit appointments. The formula you’d want to use here would be a FILTER function wrapped in a SORT, and I can be more specific if this is the way you want to go.

Wrapping the FILTER function in a SORT is the simplest way to re-order that data, which you’re already doing.

For your second question: no, it’s not currently possible to have the formula in the heading of a table. Best way around this is to visually simulate a table via alternating colors and data validation.

googlesheets,Query and array formula issues with date and chronological order,"Hello.  I am trying to chart the number of books and pages read by year/month, but when I use an array formula and query to summarize the raw data, the months are not listed in chronological order and I have to use a helper table to properly chart the results. I would also like to add a date constraint to the query. 

My actual spreadsheet’s dashboard uses a start and end date and works fine in all my other queries, but I can’t get it to work with this specific ‘Books and Pages’ query.

Sample data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11BjXv0uaKlnHskTHp-oc-CZc6fUoEUQ0esXvIZpXuZ8/edit?usp=sharing

Issues I need help with:
1. Date Constraint - What’s wrong with my formula in G5? When I add the date constraint, it works (Feb 2024 is excluded), but it stops the array formula from grouping the books by year/month.
2. Chronological order - See formula in K5, I’ve removed the date constraint. As you can see, the query outputs 2023-1, 2023-10, 2023-11, 2023-12, 2023-2, 2023-3, etc., so the double digit months are not in the correct order. I’ve been using a helper table as a workaround, but I’d like to get rid of the helper table since I have to manually relink it at the start of every month in Q4.

Is there a more elegant solution to get rid of the helper table and just chart straight from the query with a date constraint?

Here you go, duplicated your tab and fixed both QUERY's.  Only real change is that the grouped date format in the QUERY table looks slightly different.  Both QUERY's are straight from the raw data columns, it also avoids the use of your ARRAYFORMULA's within the QUERY data.

First of all, this is the first time I make a post like this, so far I've always been able to find solutions on my own. I don't really know how much detail is needed, so I'll detail a lot. Sorry in advance if some details are superfluous.

# Context

I'm working on a game. For this game I have a tableau with one sheet for each category of game object (I use this tableau as a tool to crunch the numbers). Each sheet also have the objects' name and description in different languages, and a single sheet automatically compiles all of the names and descriptions. (The purpose of the compliling sheet is to be extracted as a CSV and read in Unity.)

[Functionning Compiling Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/hsxgchfrgazd1.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=4966c6a9aa503309fa2fbe6464dd3ee596a5c823)

In the compiling sheet, I manually enter an object's keys. From that, the sheet finds what type of object it is, in which sheet it is, and in what column the key is. Once that is done, it returns the text of every key in every language.

# Problem - General

I'm having an issue converting two columns in array formulas: column D (the one finding the column number of the key) and columns F-G (the ones returning the text)

Here are the formulas:

Column D - Extended from D3: `=MATCH(IFS(REGEXMATCH(A3, ""desc""), ""Desc_"", REGEXMATCH(A3, ""name""), ""Name_"", 1, """") & ""Key"", INDIRECT(C3 & ""!A1:1""), 0)`  
Column D - Array in D2: `={""Column Number - Array Formula"" ; ArrayFormula(IfError(MATCH(IFS(REGEXMATCH(A3:A, ""desc""), ""Desc_"", REGEXMATCH(A3:A, ""name""), ""Name_"", 1, """") & ""Key"", INDIRECT(C3:C & ""!A1:1""), 0)))}`

Column F - Extended from F3: `=VLOOKUP($A3, INDIRECT(ADDRESS(2, $D3,, 1,$C3) & "":"" & ADDRESS($B$1, $D3+F$1,, 1)), 1+F$1, 0)`  
Column F - Array in F2: `={""Fr - Array Formula"" ; ArrayFormula(VLOOKUP($A3:A, INDIRECT(ADDRESS(2, $D3:D,1, 1,$C3:C) & "":"" & ADDRESS($B$1, $D3:D+F$1,1, 1)), 1+F$1, 0))}`

# Column D

For the column D, I think have a pretty good idea what the problem is, but I have no clue how to solve it.

[Column D Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/rizuzscuiazd1.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=b33dbee944c9f239ec8ba2e21e37a9fd83585f75)

As you can see on the image above, the array formula returns the same values for both dogs and cats. This means that it takes into account the type of key (desc or name), but not for what sheet the key is in.

[Column D with cat 1st](https://preview.redd.it/t1369tvijazd1.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed6f332cd1472c621dad0eaafb602e2f11fa4bdd)

If we replace the object's key from the doggos sheet in A3 with object's key from the kitties sheet, we see that now all column numbers returned by the array formula are considered to be a part of the kitties sheet.

Looking at the formula, this probably means that the ""A3:A"" part works properly, but for some reason the ""C3:C"" part seems to always be considered to be C3.  
`=ArrayFormula(IfError(MATCH(IFS(REGEXMATCH(A3:A, ""desc""), ""Desc_"", REGEXMATCH(A3:A, ""name""), ""Name_"", 1, """") & ""Key"", INDIRECT(C3:C & ""!A1:1""), 0)))`

The problem might come from using INDIRECT() in an ArrayFormula, but I have no idea how to fix it.

# Column F

To be honest, I tried fewer things on this one. The array formula returns a #VALUE! error everywhere but on the header, saying that ""Function ADDRESS parameter 2 value is 0"".

The thing is, parameter 2 of the ADDRESS functions (which is the column) takes, the value of a cell in the D column, which can never be negative. I have absolutely no clue as to what's happening there.

Here's [the link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CPPqZTLFPwN3JeJvb0brRhKdiFOe3vnSkbJcIaelmGY/edit?usp=sharing) to the example sheet from which these screenshots come. If you have any idea on how to solve any of these problems I'd be very grateful!

Presumably you don't want to do it by name, since that's changing.

ID would be the most robust for a specific sheet you want to continually rename, i.e. get the ID of the sheet and save it somewhere or hardcode it in your script.

But this would do it by position, where 0 is the first (left-most) tab.

googlesheets,How to auto populate a whole column based on given data from another sheet without dragging the fill handle down for the formula,"So I have 3 sheets. In Sheet1 I have multiple columns but the only important column there is the Ticket Number which are unique and let's say it is in Column A. Also, this sheet is manually populated

Then I have these data in Sheet2.

https://preview.redd.it/jo8fw04d1wyd1.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=39c127523b790fd68349c7827383801d6dd7a129

Then in Sheet3, I wanted to display the ticket number and its latest status. I wanted it to look like this:

Ticket Number (A1)                       Latest Status (B1)

5294                                               Passed

5300                                               To Do

5301                                               Blocked

5302                                               Deployed

In Sheet3, I used this query ""=QUERY('Sheet1'!A2:E100,""SELECT A"",1)""(pasted on A2) to automatically display all the ticket numbers from Sheet1. (without me having to manually input the ticket number again in sheet3 or manually dragging the fill handle every time there is a new ticket number inserted in sheet1).

I basically wanted the same with the Latest Status column. If there is a new ticket number inserted in Sheet1, this will also be auto added in Sheet3 (which is working), then in sheet3, if the ticket number is found in sheet2, find the last occurrence, then display its ""New Status"".

Example: for ticket 5300, its last occurrence in sheet2 is in row8 so the latest status it should display in Sheet3 is ""To Do"".

What I have tried so far is inserting this formulas to Sheet3 (B1):

1. ={""Latest Status"";ARRAYFORMULA(if(len(A2:A),VLOOKUP(TO\_TEXT(A2:A),TO\_TEXT(Sheet2!$A$2:$C),3,0)))}

but this will display the first occurrence. In Sheet3 for ticket 5300 it will display ""Open"" as its latest status.

2. ={""Latest Status"";ARRAYFORMULA(if(len(A2:A),INDEX(Sheet2!$C$2:$C,MATCH(A2:A,Sheet2!$A$2:$A,0))))}

but this will only display the status for A2 for all the rows.

What's the best way to do this?

Also! A party's name might be ""John, Susan, Kate, Sammy"". These are parents (sitting together at a table) and kids (sitting at another table).

Idk what the performance will be like with the tables loaded up... the more names assigned to a table the longer it takes to check for a person sitting on duplicate tables.

That check is currently done in conditional formatting on the Seating tab which requires using a slow(?) INDIRECT to check the data on the Guests tab.

It currently works great for Row 2, but nothing below that. The problem I have is I don't know how to tell the IF function to look at any and all of Column A for this data because Column C is looking for the output of the IF function in Cell J23 (which is just a random spot I chose to output this.

Column C uses a Data Validation rule that looks here `=Sheet1!$J$23:$J$42`

So the problem arises when the formula outputs the data into a space where I could've just copied the formula downwards to make it auto change the A2 to A3 and so forth.

I'm assuming there's something I can add into the original formula to get it to look at all of Column A and affect Column C. I'm only good enough to understand what a formula is doing by following along and not knowledgeable enough to add rules.",11/02/24 13:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gi2enr/if_function_data_validation_for_multiple_rows/,2rideascooter,"You need to duplicate the J23:J42 portion, one for every row.

googlesheets,Conditional formatting issue,"Hello! I use the =COUNTIF($A:$A,A1)>1 custom formula for conditional formatting which basically compares data in the selected cell range and highlights duplicate data.

This formula works perfectly fine in every sheet I created myself. However, it somehow gives the ""invalid formula"" error on the sheet a friend created and does not work. We tried deleting the data on the selected range and re-entering it, we added another ""mini sheet"" using the plus icon at the bottom left corner, deleted the column and created a new one but we kept getting the same error. I then created a brand new sheet with the same data and it worked (2nd image)! 

What could be the reason behind the error we get on the sheet created by my friend? Is there something that I'm missing maybe? Any way to fix this or any other similar formula we could use?

For each week (KW), I want to add all ""Dauer"" values (column D), if the checkmark is set for a day in that week. Sometimes, I set more than one checkmark for a lesson in a week, these should only be counted once. So for example in Week KW 45, I want the formula to add 3,3 (D11) and 0,6 (D13), resulting in 3,9.

To rephrase, I'd like to see if I do the amount of work that needs to be done to finish the whole project in the allocated timeframe. Days to deadline is in D3, Remaining workload (hours) in R2. In R3, I calculated \`=R2/(D3/7)\`, so that's roughly the amount of work per week (hours) to finish the project in time.",11/04/24 17:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gjsxvh/how_to_add_values_if_multiple_checkmarks_are/,daPhipz,"Here is a single cell formula to do the entire range at once:

For this formula, just change the D10:D19 range to your full range of values down the left side in column D.  Then change the range of column letters (currently F and Z) to your first and last column (the range across must remain in weeks of 7 columns).

Edit. If you get an error when trying out the formula, just replace every comma with a semicolon.  Let me know if issues adapting it to your larger sheet and I'm happy to help troubleshoot.

googlesheets,Conditional formatting assistance,"Hi there, 

I have a golf handicap spreadsheet I use to keep track of a few people's handicaps. Data for each round played is added at the bottom and their handicap is calculated. I'm hoping to add some conditional formatting to visualise the data easier for each player. Below is a link to an example:

This person's handicap would be calculated by taking the AVERAGE of the LOWEST EIGHT differentials in the LAST TWENTY rounds. I would love to have the 8 lowest values out of the last 20 values highlighted. 

Is there a way to set this up so that when another score is added to the bottom, the conditional formatting will only look at the latest 20 scores?",11/04/24 4:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gjauln/conditional_formatting_assistance/,liquorlip,"The problem was that the CF rule checks for blanks, but your formula didn't put blanks in ""empty"" cells, but rather an empty string (which is not the same as blank).

I updated your formula in M column, so it returns blanks instead of """" and now the CF works (but i changed the format, to be more ""decisive"" :) )

I guess i could have also changed the CF to check for empty strings - but it's in general a better practice to leave cells truly empty, that are meant to be empty. :)

Edit:

Ahh... and it also matters that the ""min 8 out of 20"" rule comes before the ""last 20"" rules.

A1 Apple

A2 Orange

A3 Car

A4 Cabage

A5 Chair

A6 Sky

**I want**

A1: Food

B2: Food

B3: Object

B4: Food

B5: Object

B6: <empty field, nothing to display if nothing matches wrods in A>

Don't worry, in A will be many types but it will be fixed so I don't need some type of AI to determind its category.

googlesheets,"PivotTable for list of all email addresses tagged with a specific status, across multiple worksheets","I hope this is easy—I'm working on a shared Google Sheet with other people and it's sort of evolved to be not that organized. It is an invitation list, with columns for names, email addresses, and RSVP status, with the status being drop-down chips where people can choose between ""Awaiting response,"" ""Confirmed,"" and ""Declined."" The thing is that we have a different worksheet for each category of invitee, which I don't think is ideal, but it helps the others follow along with the grouping.

I'm hoping to make a PivotTable, or otherwise use formulas, to make a single sheet that spits out a list of all email addresses for each status so that I can have a dynamic, live-updating list of those with ""Confirmed,"" and then copy and paste those email addresses to send one message, then a separate list of all the ""Awaiting response"" people, so I can send a follow-up reminder invitation, et cetera.

I think what probably makes this needlessly complex is that the invitee list is broken down into these separate worksheets, but at this point, as a group project there would be pushback if I tried to change things up (such as merging it into a single sheet), so I'm hoping for a solution to get a list of emails corresponding to each status, even if the list is being maintained in an imperfect way.

googlesheets,Updated forecast formula to take into account days lapsed in current month,"Hi all,  
I'm back with the forecasting question I had a few weeks ago.  After looking at it for  a few days, I realized it's not taking into account days lapsed in the current month.  I did get some great help getting this started and it's a great start.  But I'm still not smart enough to figure out how to manipulate the formula.  
This example has a starting week date of 10/21/24.  I have 3 units left forecasted to sell in the last 11 days of October.  In March, it says I will sell 15 (basically one every other day, so that would be sold out on about day 25 in March).  That is roughly 155ish days out.  The current formula has 177 days.  but if I just subract 21 from that, it's 156.  So is there a way to update this formula below to incorporate the shortened rest of month?

I created it with dropdown boxes (using Data-> Data Validation), to eliminate typos messing up the formulas. I also color-coded the forklift drivers to be different from the ""other"" employees, and color-coded the two different schedules to be different, to make them stand out better to me. These are completely optional, but I think helpful.

For each day, it will count the number of scheduled times (it doesn't count any blanks), so Sunday's formula for ""Total workers"" is 

=COUNTIF(C3:C12, ""<>"")

If you manually count the number of scheduled times, you'll see that there are 7, and that is the total that the formula gets too.

Since the # of forklift drivers depends on two criteria -- if they're working that day AND if they're a forklift driver, you'd use 

=COUNTIFS(C3:C12, ""<>"",$B$3:$B$12,""Forklift Driver"")

The first part is exactly the same as the ""total workers"" formula, but the second part requires that the person scheduled is also a forklift driver.

You could use the same sort of formula to show how many people start at 4 and how many start at 6, and even break it down to ""# of people who work on this day AND start at 4 \*AND\* who are forklift drivers.

Once you get the formula right for the first day, you can click and drag it over to fill in the formulas for the rest of the week, as long as you use $ to lock the row/column data for ""forklift driver"", so it will stay the same even when you copy it to the other columns.

googlesheets,How to conditionally format duplicates in a list of songs,"Hello! So, I have a big sheet with a list of song titles and artists. Song titles are in column C, artist names are in column D. There are over 2500 of them. I'm adding to this list of songs each week, and every three months or so I change the background colour of the cells so that they're colour coded by the seasons.

I'd really like to set it up so that if the combination of song title AND artist name appears twice anywhere in the sheet, then all text in both rows is made bold while retaining the original cell background colour. Essentially, I want to automatically highlight duplicate songs, without highlighting two songs that happen to share a title.

Is there an easy way to do this? I don't have much experience with Google Sheets and the solutions that Gemini has been offering always seem to highlight random cells that don't match the criteria.

I basically want a formula for my ""Total"" column that will calculate the subtotal and other/tip columns starting on the row of the name up until a new name is ran into within column B. So for example, Mario's total would be 15$ on the same row, Luigi's total would be stored at H7 and would equal to $80 with H5-H6 being a dashed line as a result of the formula sensing empty spaces below the name (thus moving the total calculated value a row down), and DK would be $25 on the same row.

googlesheets,Combining Sums From Two Cells,"# What I Am Working On

I'm working on a personal finances sheet for myself. I have my F14 cell summing 15% of my income from cell B6 (this is for paying off a debt) and I have cell I13 subtracting my total expenses, which is calculated in cell I12, from my total income from cell B6.

# What I Want

What I want to accomplish is to add the remaining income I have left, displayed in cell I13, to cell F14.

With the way I am attempting to do this I keep getting #REF! or #ERROR!

# Current Working Formulas 

The formula I am currently using in cell F14 is:

=SUM(0.15\*B6)

The formula I am currently using in cell I13 is:

=SUM(B6-I12) 

  
***\*\*\* I12 is using the formula ""=SUM(K8:K10)"" to calculate my totals from my essentials expenses, expenses for fun, and investing. K8 through K10 respectively use the same formula to calculate the sum of expenses in their respective category using the formula*** ***=sum(B8:B99) \*\*\****



# My Attempts

Unsuccessful methods I have already used in cell F14 to add my remaining funds from cell I13 are (I really do not know what I'm doing lol!):

*=SUM(0.15\*B6,I13)*

*=SUM(0.15\*B6+I13)*

*=SUM(0.15\*B6)+(I13)*

*=SUM(0.15\*B6),I13*

*=SUM(0.15\*B6),(I13)* 



# Summary

I want to add the sum from **I13** to the sum in **F14**.

**B6** is my total income

**F14** is 15% of my income dedicated towards paying off a debt using the formula *=SUM(0.15\*B6)*

**I12** is adding my Fundamental Expenses, Fun Expenses, and Future Me Expenses (Future Me Expenses includes money dedicated toward paying off debt). The formula in this cell is *=SUM(K8:K10)* where **K8** is Fundamental Expenses, **K9** is Fun Expenses, and **K10** is Future Me Expenses.

**K8** is summing my total Fundamental Expenses using the formula *=sum(B8:B99)*

**K9** and **K10** are respectively the same as **K8** formula.

**I13** is subtracting **B6** from **I12** using the formula *=SUM(B6-I12)*",11/03/24 10:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1giqfao/combining_sums_from_two_cells/,RickyRayD333,"For anyone else that sees this; final solution was just =I13, but really it was fixing the circular dependency error by adjusting the K10 sum to exclude where the new formula was.

Its easy to get messed up if you copy/paste unless you carefully paste ""values only"", because otherwise the conditional format gets copied with the cell.

To see **every** format rule in your sheet, select all the cells before opening the formatting sidebar, are start hammering the trash icon.

One way to help avoid problems is to set your entire sheet -- or at least the data portion of it where you may be doing copy/pasting -- as the conditional format range.

Then if you copy/paste the conditional formatting rules for each cell remain unchanged and valid.

You would then need to make your formulas more complex with custom formulas, but the extra effort up front may be worth less hassle down the road.

In this example, you could select your entire sheet and then use this custom formula:

googlesheets,"IF Condition to return either ""-"" or COUNTIF results","Hello! I've been meddling with a statistics table of sorts and while I found a couple of useful formulas in the internets that I was able to adapt, there is one somewhat complex condition (at least it seems for me) that I can't find a solution to. So I was wondering whether perhaps someone could help me out please?

Here is the example: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPqZxFAKB-76xOHItLv9MTmzb3jHEf3KSmp5-5IlwsE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPqZxFAKB-76xOHItLv9MTmzb3jHEf3KSmp5-5IlwsE/edit?usp=sharing)

There is a list of names on the Statistics sheet. There is Sheet 1 sheet, but later, once in a couple of months, new sheets (Sheet 2, Sheet 3, etc.) will become available. All these numbered sheets will have the names from the list on Statistics sheet and there are three designated states for these names:

\* name is present on the sheet and has some data (as in non-empty cell condition) in column B, it could be a text or a number

\* name is present on the sheet but has no data (as in empty cell condition) in column B

\* name is not present on the sheet

The goal of this statistics is to show who has completed a certain monthly task and who didn't yet. At first I used a COUNTIF formula and it works alright by showing 1 for those who have completed the task (added their name and result) and showing 0 for those who haven't (didn't add a name).

But sometimes a person will not have enough materials to complete the task, so the idea is to still ask this person to add his name to the list in Sheet 1 (as in ""I haven't forgot about the task""), but leave the column B empty (as in ""I don't have enough materials this month""). The problem is that showing 1 on the Statistics sheet in this case would be a bit misleading, because I won't be able to tell whether the task was really completed (Column B has some data) or whether there were not enough materials (Column B is empty).

Is there a way to somehow enhance the formula like IF(Name on the list is present on the sheet + Column B is empty, return ""—""; otherwise use my current COUNTIF and return a number of how many times the name is present)?

I've spent an hour trying to figure it out but I can't get it to not give me an error. I can make a separate query that does this, but I'd like it to be tied to this.

Here's the formula for those that can't see the sheet:

=QUERY(A:E,""Select E, Avg(D), Count(E) WHERE A IS NOT NULL group by E order by Count(E) desc label E '',Avg(D) '', Count(E) ''"", 1)

The formula in G2 for the helper column is: `=BYROW(D2:D,LAMBDA(x,IF(ISBLANK(x),,IF(x>3,1,0))))` and it produces a 1 if the rating is above a 3 and a 0 if the rating is 3 or below. This allows us to add up the number of shows that had a higher rating for each app, without adding an additional constraint to the Query.

Your revised Query formula would be: 

    =QUERY(A:G, ""Select E, Avg(D), Count(E), Sum(G)

I'm having trouble with a conditional formatting function on Google Sheet, I hope you can help me.

I have a table that contains data (only numbers). The sums are shown in columns labelled C and D, which exist for each day of the month.

* The green cells show the sum of the data in column C, by day.
* The yellow cells display the sum of the same data in C, per day, but calculated differently (I'll skip the details), giving a quick look at any errors made by the humans filling in the table.

[All numbers are random for the example. Please, don't try to understand why 78 becomes 23, it's just to create a deliberate error so that we can work on the function I'm interested in.](https://preview.redd.it/s9xt8v4yf9yd1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cf73c8204839a9e5d762a344978f0b37ffc217e)

I'd like to create a conditional formatting function that colors in red the initially green and yellow cells when they're not equal, for every day of the month, without the function stopping at the first mismatch it finds. I could just create 1 conditional formatting PER DAY, but I think there's a way of doing this more intelligently, given that the columns are labelled with C and D.

I've tried =INDEX($D2:$FB2;;EQUIV(“C”;$D$2:$FB$2;0))=INDEX($D2:$FB2;;EQUIV(“D”;$D$2:$FB$2;0)) applied to $D$3:$FB$3 but it doesn't work and I can't quite figure out why, so I hope you can help me. Perhaps even the very structure of this attempted function isn't right ?

* And one for the rolling balances.

googlesheets,Using Xlookup with another function to return relative row number,"I am working on centralizing the data for our fantasy hockey league's annual draft. Currently, we have a different document for each year. Our league uses keepers and therefore pulls data from the previous year (and beyond) into the current year to inform the list of draftable players. The current draft table lists the team owner and team name across in the first two rows, and the drafted round in column A. My goal is to be able to input the owner (they change less often than team names) and the player name, and return the round in which the player was drafted.

This is the result table I would like to have for one specific owner, Chad.

I want to input Chad and Adin Hill and return the round drafted.

The data is pulling from a different sheet (2023 Draft) and looks like this (I have hidden some of the other owners):

https://preview.redd.it/b1gw7ut7etxd1.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ef4b445c4b64dda85a1d8dd4c7a85143c3e56b0

Adin Hill is in blue, so the result I expect is ""11"". If Joe were keeping Zach Hyman, the result would be 7.

I have tried using nested XLOOKUPs. The ""successful"" version returned Adin Hill, with the following code:

=XLOOKUP(A8,'2023 Draft'!B1:K1,XLOOKUP(A10,'2023 Draft'!I3:I22,'2023 Draft'!B3:K22))

The unsuccessful ones give me the N/A error and look something like this:

=XLOOKUP(A8,'2023 Draft'!B1:K1,XLOOKUP(A10,'2023 Draft'!B3:K22,'2023 Draft'!A3:A22))

I have also tried using ROWS and MATCH as the nested function to no avail.

I would like to be able to scale this for each owner to be able to enter their keepers in a mini-table like the first screen cap, that will pull the draft information from the previous year. Then, in the setup for the subsequent season, I will add another section on the keepers tab for the 2025-2026 keepers, etc. Draft position changes from year-to-year, so each owner will not be in the same column for each season's draft page.

My sheets/excel skill level is advanced, and I am always looking to learn more. I use Chrome. Here is a copy of the [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UhwHEbiyZv3P8dvygV_VoOzQnNbHnSVA4cgQW4J2iTY/edit?usp=sharing).

googlesheets,Stopping Date Formatting for Non-Date Value,"I have a table that's automatically filled through IMPORTHTML - the values in one column are being formatted automatically as a date, but how can I have these values stay exactly as they are and not be changed?

For example, one value is 4-4-0 which is being auto-formatted to 4-4-2000.

When I change it to Plain Text it gets changed to 36620.  I've tried custom formatting to 0-0-0 but it just becomes 366-2-0.

Since it isn't manually typed data I can't just add ' to each value and it's one column out of 17 in an imported table so I don't believe I can just adjust the import formula since the necessary formatting would be different for each column.

Is there no format option to just leave whatever the value is imported without trying to format/change it to something?  Ideally I would like to fix this without adding a helper column.

googlesheets,classifying text by searching for matches in another range.,"I have over 3000 campaign names from which I have to extract the month names, There are few problems here because of inconsistent naming across campaigns. 

1. The month name can be at any place in the campaign name  Ex: ""**January\_Promo\_PPC\_Awareness**"" or ""**Awareness\_January\_PPC\_Promo**"" or any other place 
2. Second problem is the spelling is inconsistent   Ex ""**January\_Promo\_PPC\_Awareness**"" or ""**Jan\_Promo\_PPC\_Awareness**"" or ""**Jaaanuary\_Promo\_PPC\_Awareness**"" etc

All the examples provided should be classified into January only. And there are 1000s of names like these which needs to be classified into one of twelve months. 

The approach I have tried is 

I have made a reference sheet, where I will keep all the misspellings in column A and the correct class in column B. 

Then for each campaign name, I would search all the names in column A of reference sheet, and If campaign name contains any of the misspell anywhere in the campaign name, It should return the correct name available in column B. 

The logic is foolproof, It work's perfectly when I tried coding with python using loops. But I have to do this in google sheets only as I have a dashboard linked to this. I am not fluent in app script to do this, So I want to just do this using simple formulas. 

I tried using the search function, But this is not scalable. I have used only first 8 rows in reference sheet to check if it works, and It does work, But I can't write this formula for my whole reference sheet, as I have around 100 rows in reference sheet, Which would repeat 100 lines of below formula

    =IF(IFERROR(SEARCH(Reference!$A$2,A2),0)>0,Reference!$B$2,

I want all six titles to automatically appear in one long column alongside another author column in the master tab, alphabetically sortable by either the title or author. If I were to later add *Brave New World* by Aldous Huxley to the 'Fiction' tab, it should automatically show up in the master tab between *Becoming Dr. Seuss* and *Emma* (or between ""Capote, Truman"" and ""Jones, Brian Jay"" if sorted by author).

With the process you describe in your post, you’ll be able to add a SORT in the formula itself (as the titles populate the master sheet) so it can be sorted by title A to Z or whatever, but not via the “sort this column” option.

googlesheets,Counting number of people who answered yes to anything in a certain category.,"

Hi,

I have an export of survey responses. People are asked if they ate certain types of foods (3 main categories): fruit, vegetables, or meat in the last month. There is no question that directly asks if they ate anything in that food category. Instead they are only asked: did you eat chicken? Did you eat steak? Did you eat fish? ect for 20+ questions. 

I don’t care what type of food in the category they ate, just the number of people who ate anything (=1) from each category in the last month. 

The export is unorganized and the categories are intermixed. I can’t change how it’s exported. I could rearrange the columns but I don’t really have the time to do that on a regular basis. Below is an simplified example of the formatting.

Yellow columns would be asking “Did you eat ___?” And the columns not highlighted I don’t care about either (how often, how much). 

Is there a way to do this?

Provided that you have a lookup table of IDs and associated categories, getting counts of people answering yes in a category is possible. This assumes that every export has IDs that exist in the IDs lookup table. If an export ID is not in the IDs lookup table, it must be added to the lookup table to be considered.

googlesheets,Inventory Quantity and Value Tracker,"Hello! I am building an inventory tracker for the ecommerce company I work fork, but I'm having trouble getting the results I'm actually looking for.

In my workbook, I have tabs for individual POs. These include the SKU, purchase quantity and cost. As new POs are received by the warehouse, I'll add a new tab with the corresponding PO info. The inventory report will change 1 to 3 times a week. Ideally I would like a summary tab where my CEO and COO can easily see the available quantity of a given SKU and the total value of that available quantity. The inventory value would be calculated based on the purchase price of the SKU in the POs (purchase price is subject to change).

I created the tab ""FIFO Valuation"" (FIFO = First In First Out). It shows the SKU, the available quantity and then lists the POs from Column C onward, pulling the quantity and unit cost from the PO tabs. The interwebs suggested I use the formula **=MIN(B9,C9)\*D9** (B9 = Available Qty, C9 = PO Qty, D9 = PO Unit Cost). But this isn't getting me to my end goal.

I can't figure out how to make a running total for the FIFO value. As inventory is reduced, the value should be reduced by the cost of the product in the oldest PO it appears in. As inventory is recieved, the quantity and value will be increased by the newest PO.

Here is a copy of the workbook I am dealing with. All SKUs and numbers are made up. I am at a loss at this point so any tips or other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

that top section says that there are 16 gifts left to buy and 16 gifts bought — meaning there are 32 gifts total, half of which have been purchased. the pie chart is displaying this correctly.

if all gifts have been bought, the ""left to buy"" section should be 0. is this what you're trying to achieve?

googlesheets,Unique combination pairs over multiple rounds,"Hello, all!

I am in a class where two students are paired with each other every week to practice language learning. What I am trying to get is a unique pairing of combinations (kind of like round-robin but with a bit extra detail) where one person is matched with another person only once before repeating. I know there are variations of round-robin combinations out there, but the additional detail that I am trying to incorporate involves new students joining the class midway.

In the [example sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1THBjJGUZsDgPVgMvcT5LWuNE8tX7XxWSQV6yJppZm38/edit?usp=sharing), I have a list of all 12 students. In week 1, I have 11 students and pairing is done at random with the 11th student having independent learning because of odd number of students. In week two, there is a rotation with Jared being independent. In week 3, Angela has joined bringing the total number to 12 and now all students are paired, but previous combinations were not repeated.

How can the sheet be set up so that I can replicate this for the \~50 students that participate in the class? Sheet 2 shows how I would like the output where there is a dropdown for rounds of participation and each round will result in a unique pairing.

Thank you very much in advance for all the help!",10/20/24 13:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1g865x3/unique_combination_pairs_over_multiple_rounds/,h_plus_a,"Check out this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KfcL1AzQa1QUvCNONQ8OWFrTCmA3Q5EBfafbfYdyobI/edit?usp=sharing) I made to help you out each week. You can Make a Copy from the File Menu.

How to Setup:

* Replace my test names with your student names.
* If you want your student names sorted alphabetically, now is the time to do it. Only sort the range of names. Nothing else. **Do not ever sort the names after this initial setup**.
* Add new students to the bottom of the list. **Do not sort**.
* Delete students that will no longer be considered part of future pairings. Leave their slot blank. If their checkbox was checked, uncheck it. **Do not sort**.
* If you already have pre-assigned pairings: You can add them to the ""Previously Paired Students"" list, starting where the gray box is. Add each pair of names to their own row. Also, very important, the name in the left column should come before the name in the right column alphabetically. For example, if Cameron Bradley and Avery Cole were paired up, Avery Cole's name will be in the left column and Cameron Bradley's name will be in the right column.

How to Use:

1. Click the Checkbox in cell D2
2. Copy the range of Random Pairings in D5 to E?
3. Paste Values Only to the first empty cell in G5 to G? (a gray box shows you where). When you do this, the Random Pairings list will refresh itself. Ignore this.
4. If there is a randomly selected student for Independent Study, click the Checkbox next to their name in A5 to A? (their name is highlighted yellow). When you do this, the randomly selected student for Independent Study will refresh itself. Ignore this.
5. Uncheck the Checkbox in cell D2

The sheet shows hints on ""How to Use"" it. Always use it in the exact order I described.

The sheet will only handle up to 100 names. As the list of names grow, the sheet will perform slower. Please do not attempt to customize the sheet.

Column F is my full list, which contains elemens missing in column B, so I guess I need to synchronize them so B would have blank spaces for mismatches with F, then I can pretty much just copy paste H to C? Then I can delete columns F G and H and the file I could upload to my woocommerce and it'd update all the prices I think, in bulk, I've been doing this manually but it's 2 days already and haven't finished, there must be a better way

I have a spreadsheet of EFx237 cells of sports results. Most of the cells are filled with a lookup that fills the cell with ""YYY"" if those teams never played, ""XXX"" if it's the mirror match, and looks to see if I've already typed in a score for AAA vs BBB, and fills it in for BBB vs AAA.

`=if(columns($A:DH)>rows($1:108), right(offset($A$1,columns($A:DH),rows($1:108)), len(offset($A$1,columns($A:DH),rows($1:108))) - iferror(find(""~"",offset($A$1,columns($A:DH),rows($1:108))),0)) & iferror(""~""&left(offset($A$1,columns($A:DH),rows($1:108)), find(""~"",offset($A$1,columns($A:DH),rows($1:108)))-1),""""), if(columns($A:DH)=rows($1:108),""XXX"",""YYY""))`

That doesn't seem ideal.

By far the best would be to rewrite that monster formula from scratch so it's not slow.  Maybe with some pre-calculated hidden helper rows or something if needed.

If that's still too slow...

1. Duplicate your sheet to one called **Cached**.  On that new sheet, copy/paste values over everything, wiping out all the formulas.
2. On your existing sheet, add (yet some more) code to your function to check if the cached sheet contains a value in the same cell location, and if so grab it and short-circuit out of the rest of your formula.
3. The next time things get slow, copy/paste values from your live sheet onto the Cached sheet, with no need to do anything else.

If something gets screwed up, or at the start of a new season or whatever, just clear your cache and your (slow) formula magically recalculates everything.

It would be simple to write some App Script that did #3 for you automatically, so whenever things got slow you could re-cache your data at the click of a button.

    )

I have tried to wrap ""INDEX(concat\_then\_split, , 1)"" i e a range containing a date into every parcing function possible but had no luck. I suppose that's because QUERY() wants a numbers formatted as a date and neither text not pure numbers.

I know i can make it go using filter or comparing date just as a value (which I suspect sometimes gives me an incorrect result). My goal is to make it run without helper table, using query, since my actual formula includes more QUERY() functionality.

From there i use the drop down menus to fill in the details of their plan, and at the bottom get a total.

(Hiiii me again) There's no possible way i explain this well enough so please go easy on me (ignore the formatting looking rubbish, i copied it to the example sheet wrong)

Essentially, i have a collection tracker set up such that in each series, each unique item in a series has 5 different variants that i want to track with checkboxes. Each checkbox want to have color coded, and i want to keep track of how many of each i've gotten on a per series basis AND a total basis.  
The problem is the only way i figured out how to track the totals is jury rigged and janky. I'm sure there's a better way to do it, but i've already input a lot of data in the real deal, so im stuck working with what's already been made, as the CF was equally ham fisted and would break if i tried to restructure.

I've figured out how to use a regex to actually read the numbers before and after the / just fine, and ive figured out some basic array nonsense, but i just cant seem to figure out how to display it in a way that A: doesn't force me to do everything by hand, which i could do if not for B: that i need it to be open for me to add to the entries if i need to.  
I feel like it should be a simple matter of checking the row arrays, reading both numbers, and summing them, but i just cant figure out how, or if i even can. I included all the potentially helpful formulas i found in the sheet. Any help would be greatly appreciated",10/25/24 9:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gbv4rb/how_to_count_totals_from_a_given_array_if_numbers/,ChillyFlake,"u/ChillyFlake I'd recommend using the formulas that already exist rather than writing your own. This, along with the multitude of conditional formatting, will slow down the processing of your sheet and is over complicated for the solution you're wanting.

For the total row, you can simply use `=COUNTIF(D$11:D,TRUE)&""/""&COUNTA(C$11:C)` in C4.

For the Variant total, you can use a variation of that same structure: `=COUNTIFS(C$11:C,B5,D$11:D,TRUE)&""/""&COUNTIF(C$11:C,B5)` in C5. Because this references the Variant name in B5 (rather than hardcoding it in the formula itself), you can drag it down to apply to all the variants listed. 

You can then copy/paste the entire Totals table (B4:C9) to all the other tables to get the totals for each Series.

These formulas can be seen in a sample sheet [linked here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15JFYv9Xg1pUvkjfkPjr1_zOCZvhqpa1_Bjbl2ckzhlA/edit?usp=sharing).

All the formulas require the variant names to be written consistently, and you have some spelling discrepancies in some of the series.

UC1025 < UC925 because they are sorting alphabetically and 1 < 9

You could use XLOOKUP() instead, with your same two ranges followed by ""missing value"" parameter (or leave it blank), followed by ""search mode"" which is 0 for exact match, e.g.:

XLOOKUP(B1,Sheet1!B:B,Sheet1!A:A, , 0)

But a better idea may be to generate the codes in such a way so they naturally sort alphabetically.

That also allows you to directly compare two codes with a simple < or other comparison operator.

To do that you'd want to put the year first followed by the month, with leading zeroes on the month, e.g:

googlesheets,Having non-merged cells maintain the same fill color as the first cell in the row?,"Okay, so here's what my Sheets template currently looks like.

I have 3 columns and 8 rows, with the first five being merged for columns A and B. I didn't give Alternating Colors any thought until this happened: the five non-merged cells at the top of column C still alternate colors because they are still technically considered separate rows.

I'd like for every element in the collective ""row"" to share the same fill color, as shown below.

https://preview.redd.it/wsgbarb9vxwd1.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&s=df6ba2306e3dcbadaffc4295642bdb9c5364c2ec

Given my limited knowledge of Google Sheets, I tried filling the white rows with the light blue fill color. It's a simple fix, provided I don't add any rows above it. However, I'd like to have it so that the collective ""row"" maintains its shared alternating color scheme despite the addition or removal or rows above it. Example below.

I feel like the Conditional Format Rules option may be the key, but I'm not sure how to format it to achieve my desired goal. Is this even possible? Worst case, I will just go in and manually change the fill color, but if there's a way that I can automate it then that would be wonderful!

The bottom line though is; this is not trivial to deal with in the manner you are hoping for.

[Example Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11jIQpQDMmV6IjSVfUXUww92UPRoUaDlgwo2EawFB3wg/edit?usp=sharing)

I'm trying to keep track of a collection (simplified for explanation in the sample sheet) with a list where all unique items from a series (each with 5 variants each) have a checklist entry in a column, and then in the next column is the next series (with an equal amount of variants per item).

I can set up one Series easily, using a =LOWER command cf so that each variant listing + the checkbox that tracks it is colored, and copy pasting an entry if i want to make a new one in a series works easily.

The problem is i cannot do the same for adding another series. Due to how the copy paste works for CF, it will always act as if its in the same series as the original. I've actually done this once before, but it was only 5 series, so i didnt care. But with this i have potentially dozens of series to enter, right now at least 30, and i want to know if theres any better way to do it than manually adding 5 unique CF's for each series.

Also, if theres simply a better way to do this. I don't think Tables would work any better, since my main problem is the CF",10/24/24 22:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gblfd7/how_to_easily_copy_cfmake_a_simple_checklist_i/,ChillyFlake,"u/ChillyFlake remove the absolute `$` from your custom formula so the `$D3` would be `D3` instead. (I’m not entirely sure the purpose of the LOWER part of your custom formula, but this should allow it to transfer to the other series column sets.

Edit: this would prevent column C from being color coded the same way. In addition to what I described above, have two rules for each color: one for the column with the checkbox itself and the other rule for the column beside it. (Neither rule should have an absolute reference.) Then the rules can be copied over to the next series (and the next…) without issue.

First off, there are (at least) two major types of loans; a) the one where you pay a fixed amount every month/year with fixed interests rates and then b) the one where you pay a varying amount, with fluctuating interests. In some countries (Iceland!) you might also have to account for inflation rate, as they might have that built into the loan.

Then you have to know how your particular loaner calculates interests. Are they based on yearly rate / 12, do they use a 360 day year, with 30 fixed months - which comes into effect when you pay extra at some ""random"" days.

Type a) loans are a bit more complicated to calculate, when it comes to taking extra payments into account.

My suggestion would be to find a good loan calculator out there that can take your additional payments into account, and just go with that.

Or you can do your own calculator and go with a ""good enough"" estimate of course :) I guess it wouldn't really have to be perfect if it's just for your self.

It can be done in Apps Script, which I did and tested... only to run into a 30 second cap for executing apps script via a simple trigger.

So I changed my code to cap the timer at 28 seconds to make sure it finishes in time.   

There is probably a workaround for that as well but I ran out of motivation. :)

Apps Script is not very speedy or even consistent in its speed, so YMMV how smoothly the timer will run.  And you must be signed into a Google account or it won't run at all.

googlesheets,How to simplify a formula that calculates amount of money earned per employee per day,"Hi friends,

I've created a spreadsheet with dummy data to help explain my problem.

I run a small facility for therapy for children with various cognitive and physical difficulties, with a few employees that earn percentage per session. Currently I have a working formula, but it's an abomination that makes me lose sleep.

My employees enter data in a log sheet through Google Forms. One question selects their name from a dropdown menu and a second question selects their clients for the day from a multiple-choice checkbox.

The log contains timestamps in A:A, employee name in B:B and client ID numbers in C:C delimited with "", ""

Then in G2:K I split the ID numbers in multiple columns and I COUNT() them in F2:F. You can use this for the formula if you want, because it will stay in the log no matter what. I need it for catching data entry errors.

In another sheet I have a list of client ID numbers and two different prices per client. A:A is a list of unique client ID numbers, B:B is the price for March and April 2024 and C:C is the price for months after April.

There's varying prices from client to client, because for some I give family discount and for others I choose to lower the price at my discretion. Starting from May my operational costs bumped up because I installed an air conditioning system for the whole facility and on top of that my rent was raised, so I had to raise the price.

I use this formula to calculate money earned per employee per day.

    =ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(MAP(A2:A,LAMBDA(data,MULTIPLY(50/100,SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(MAP(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(ARRAYFORMULA(SPLIT(FILTER('Session Log'!C2:C,'Session Log'!B2:B=H1,INT(data)=INT('Session Log'!A2:A)),"", "",,)),COUNTA(A2:A),20),LAMBDA(dete,IF(data > DATE(2024,5,1), IFERROR(XLOOKUP(dete,'Client List'!A2:A,'Client List'!B2:B),""0""),IFERROR(XLOOKUP(dete,'Client List'!A:A,'Client List'!C2:C),""0"")))),COUNTA(A2:A),20))))),COUNTA(A2:A),1)

It's horrible. I know. Please help me fall asleep again.

I revamped the client and employee setup a bit and introduced a **price table** and a **price group**.

That way you only have to make a few changes when the price changes, and the formula just picks it up and works (hopefully).

Have a look at the **""New summation""**, **""Price setup""** and **""Employees""** tabs and let me know what you think of it.

I know I can simply go for =(COUNTIF (B24:AE24,""Player 1"")) but here comes the next problem.

Is there any way to make that cell always identify a specific option in the dropdown list based on which order it is in? For example, can I somehow change the formula to not look for the text ""Player 1"" but instead look for how many times I have chosen the first option in the dropdown menu, no matter what the text in it is?

I want to be able to change the names of Player 1-Player 18 but keep the formula intact if that is possible without having to change it every time I change the names of the options.

I hope I've made my question clear enough. Here's a dummy sheet that could hopefully make it clearer:

You could use one sheet per rep with dynamic date-based filtering.

Instead of creating 12 individual monthly sheets per rep, keep all commissions data in one sheet per rep.

On your master sheet, you can then filter by month or year dynamically.

Assume a single sale rep's sheet logs all sales data in one place. You can pull in January sales for a given year into your master sheet using FILTER()

  
Even better you could keep everything within one spreadsheet file. Create a new sheet and link it to a google form. The form could include questions that gather all the data you need. Sale rep's name. Start date travel, end date travel, total cost etc. Give a link to the live form to your employees. Then you could organize the data in your master sheet just by pulling named ranges from the google form table, you could filter by employee or by date.

You could save yourself the trouble of maintaining multiple spreadsheets files and avoid complicating your life with IMPORTRANGE()",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1g8viu9/linking_sheets_with_importrange/lt2k0zh/,JuniorLobster,1,,,,,,,

I need help tackling this challenge. I am a big gym bro and I like to track my workouts using google sheets and using formulas to automatically apply progressive overload. I need help fixing my ""REPS"" function to follow a new set of rules for double progression.

Double Progression is:   
Starting with a load where you feel you can get pretty close to 15 reps for 3 sets (but not quite). Then add reps each week, trying to get to the goal of 3×15. Taking as many sessions as you need to achieve this. Once you can do the top end of the rep range for all sets, increase weight and restart at the lower rep range,

Example - 3 sets of 12-15 reps:

Week 1: 40 lbs, reps 14,13,12

Week 2: 40 lbs, reps 14,14,12

Week 3: 40 lbs, reps 14,14,13

Week 4: 40 lbs, reps 12,12 (deload)

Week 5: 40 lbs, reps 15,15,14

Week 6: 40 lbs, reps 15,15,15

Week 7: 45 lbs, reps 13,12,12

Week 8: 45 lbs, reps 12,12 (deload)

Once the upper end of the rep range has been hit for the given amount of sets increase the weight and aim for the lower end. 

What I already have: 

[This photo shows how I track my workouts. I have a functions named \\""REPS\\"" that at the moment compares the old sessions weight to the new sessions weight \(the new session weight is currently automatically increasing by a given &#37; rounded to the nearest 5\) and if the weight has increase from the previous session I just reprint a string of the old sessions reps. If the weight stays the same I add one rep to each sets rep goal. You can see in the imagine my old REPS function example highlighted in yellow. ](https://preview.redd.it/nhrrybl7vzud1.png?width=2429&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4077ea6d83273b0b010fdd89a9235cfa6d81d4d)

I need to show how recode this function to increase the rep goal within the given range (a range that I want to be able to change) up to the upper end then have a function that increases the weight goal once the upper range has been hit for all sets. 

For me with very little coding experience this is a difficult task, setting up my original REPS function took years it feels like, I'd appreciate any help and suggestions to get me heading into the right direction.

googlesheets,Multiply a cell value in the same cell.,"Hello, 

Does anybody know if there is a way to multiply a value you entered in a cell and have it displayed in the same cell. 

Example of what I would like to do:

I usually tell the price of a my services in EUR. However when I'm making an official offer to a local client, I have to display the price in my countries currency which is RSD. (RSD is **EUR \* 117.5** right now).

I would like to have a blanket formula for the entire column that multiplies my entered number by 117.5.  
This way I can enter the number 10 (meaning 10 euros) and the cell would display 1175 RSD.

PS.

I know that I can make a second cell that does this, but is there a way to do it in the same cell?  
Like a formula I can apply to the entire column?

It will be a very wide sheet, but it's ok.  Sheets can handle up to ZZZ on the column lettering.  I've created a demo sheet here.  The biggest gotcha moment is when creating the dropdowns.  You want to have them refrerence the options from a range but with relative row references. In other words, with no $ in front of the row numbers.  Easy to set that in the settings area, except Sheets will place them back on the first time you do it.  Go back into the settings and remove them again and you should be good to go.

The only thing you’d need to change in the formula is the column references to match the actual column. This formula would go in the row 1 cell, and requires the column below it to be blank in order to work.

googlesheets,Weird Interaction between VLOOKUP and WRAPROWS/RAND,"[Reference](https://imgur.com/a/zqQMR7y)

SITUATION

I am trying to make a sheet for a bowling league for Blind Doubles (you put in money and get assigned a random partner and the goal is to have the best combined score with said partner over all other doubles).

  
All cells under random have the line: =IF(ISTEXT(B2), RAND(), """").

All cells under Players are just names, and all cells under Scores are just numbers.

I used WRAPROWS to make teams with: =WRAPROWS(Players, COUNTIF(Players, ""\*"")/2)

(Players is a named range that is B2:B1000)

This results in the above image. However, in cell C5 I am trying to write the following: =VLOOKUP(E2, $B:$C, 2, TRUE) + VLOOKUP(E3, $B:$C, 2, TRUE). When I do so, all teams go away and both C5 and E2 get an error saying ""Array result was not expanded because it would overwrite data in E5.""

Does anyone know why this doesn't work?

googlesheets,How do I make this scheduling/location tracker?,"I am a teacher, and apart of a program that is being piloted where students are not always in the same room every day. With this program, though, it is difficult to figure out where students are at times. 

I am wanting to create a system that looks like this (image attached). I have a couple of requirements for this sheet:

The students can check in by scanning a QR code that takes them to a Google Form where they input their current location. Their response will then populate on the sheet. The students names are on a column, and the location is next to their name. Each location would have a different color so that I could easily figure out where they are when looking at the sheet. 
The issue with this is, each time you create a response on Google forms, it creates a new row on the sheet that contains the responses. I want the name to stay the same and just the location and color to change each time. 

If possible, I also want to input some sort of setting where if a student has not checked into a room by a certain time, the box with their location next to their name will turn red. This is not an absolute requirement, though. 

I don’t really have any idea of how to do this, so any help would be greatly appreciated! ",10/18/24 15:01,https://i.redd.it/gxtekom9mkvd1.jpeg,BeautifulPlankton545,"As mentioned, a Google Form is the best option. You can control responses and each entry is timestamped. Your responses will be linked, but you will only want to use those responses as a data dump to pull into another sheet (tab in the same workbook) and leave the responses alone.

I've designed similar forms and here's what I'd do in this situation:

1. Make question 1 a dropdown of names to select. Populate that list with the names you need.  
2. Make question 2 a radio button (multiple choice) for the location. Again, populate that with the locations you want recorded.  
3. In your data sheet, list each student name in one column. In the adjacent column, you'll write the formula below with the following assumptions:  
• Your list of students are on column A of your data sheet;  
• You start your list on row 2 (because table headers are great);  
• The sheet the responses appear on is named 'Form Responses 1';  
• The timestamp is in column A of that sheet; and  
• The student name is in column B):

=MAX(FILTER('Form Responses 1'!A:A, 'Form Responses 1'!B:B = A2))

4. Assuming that you want the latest location in column C, you will use this formula:

=INDEX('Form Responses 1'!C:C, MATCH(MAX(FILTER('Form Responses 1'!A:A, 'Form Responses 1'!B:B = A2)), 'Form Responses 1'!A:A, 0))

5. Drag and autofill these two formulas for each row of your list of students. That will give the latest entry that student has made.

This will give you a three column list, with the student, latest timestamp, and latest location respectively.

From time to time, you'll want to delete all the data from your form responses sheet, but not the sheet itself.

For O12, you want the cell to show whatever number is the row/column of P6 and P7, right? 

  
If so, this is what I did:

    =INDEX(D6:H12,MATCH($P$7,$C$6:$C$12,0),MATCH($P$6,$D$5:$H$5,0))

Not sure if you care about learning about it or not, I will explain quickly below in case you wanted to!

  
**INDEX**(reference, \[row\], \[column\])

INDEX allows you to select an array range (D6:H12) and then select a row and column by numbers (so first cell, D6 would be selected if you place 1,1 for the row,column. 2,1 would go down one row, but stay in the same column, so D7. 2,2 is E7. 

**MATCH**(search\_key, range, \[search\_type\])

Match lets you then get a number based on the search key, so in this case, matching the P7 to the row. If it finds it in the first cell of the search, C6, then it is a 1. Then 2, and so on.  You can use MATCH for columns as well, so that's where now when it matches your Render type and Art type, those are converted to the numbers and in turn used for the INDEX to pull that specific Cell for the Row and Column. Search type 0 is an exact match, which is what we want for this.

googlesheets,Problem with conditional formatting and timevalues in a column,"Hi,

I try to do some conditional formatting on column B. For that I use two rules for the formatting, rule 1 is value is lesser than =TIMEVALUE(NOW()). Rule 2 is value is greater than or equal to =TIMEVALUE(NOW()+A1). The desired result is in column B now there is 1 cell with no formatting, wich is perfect, this is the active time. Things go wrong aroud timestamp 0:00:00 when all cells get formatted for some reason and I don't see why.

  
By the way, The last cell in B is never bigger than the first cell in B

I just don't see an easy solution. TIA

1. Hyperlinks and dropdowns are mutually exclusive. You could have the hyperlink exist in a helper column next to the one where you select the episode name using a method like what’s described for 2 & 3.
2. You’ll need to have another table with the episode names and dates. If this table is on a sheet (tab) called Dates, with episode names in  column A and dates in B, your formula in C2 would be: ‘=XLOOKUP(B2, Dates!A:A, Dates!B:B,,0)` and you would drag this down the column.
3. You’ll use the same strategy described in 2 for your pay rate lookup formula, referencing its own table and the cell with the participants name instead of the episode title.

I have the date in column B (using range B49:B), and the drop-down categories are in column G (G49:G). I want to sum values in column F (F49:F).

Basically what I want is to enter a date in M/D/YYYY format into column B, select a drop-down category in column G (for example, ""Grocery""), and have the spreadsheet sum all values from column F that are categorized as ""Grocery"" and dated during a given month. (Right now I'm trying to do May.)

The formula I'm using is 

=sumifs(F49:F, B49:B, 5&""*"", G49:G, ""Grocery"")

It is not summing the values in column F which have a May date (for example, 5/4/2024) in the corresponding cell in column B. HOWEVER, if I replace the criterion 5&""*"" in the above formula with the specific date ""5/4/2024"", it does sum correctly, and it will even sum multiple cells in column F which have that exact date in the corresponding cell in column B.

From this I've concluded that 5&""*"" is not the correct way to designate ""any date in May"", but I've had zero luck figuring out how to correctly represent that. 

Finally, I don't think it's relevant, but just in case, the values in column F are products of the following formula:

=if(C49<>"""", C49, if(D49<>"""", D49/E49,0))

This is because I'm tracking transactions in two currencies, so if I have a transaction in non-USD currency, I need it converted to USD before summing. I don't see why that would affect the sumifs formula, though.

Attaching some screenshots for reference. Please let me know if I can provide more info.

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks a bunch.",10/15/24 14:26,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g4g3b8,vethyn,"Give this a try:

When new responses are submitted, they come in on newly added rows. This wreaks havoc on anything you’ve done in that sheet.

Then: Add a new sheet (tab) to the same spreadsheet with your FormResponses1 tab. Title it “MIRROR” or whatever you want that will tell you it mirrors the form data coming in. In A1 of this sheet, put: `={'Form responses 1'!A1:C}`     (or whatever your last column of response data is)

You can add your existing formula(s) to this new MIRROR sheet, if you want the analysis to the side of the existing columns. Alternatively, you can reference this new MIRROR sheet in a third sheet with your TRANSPOSE function to have an easier way to analyze the data. You can then hide the MIRROR and the original Form responses sheet from view so you’re only seeing the sheet you want. It will auto update when new responses are submitted.

2. The service with the cheaper price will show next to the price. I'm struggling with this. What I want for this cell to show is either Transglobal, Parcel2go, or Royal Mail based on what the minimum price from #1 is.

Yellow: can I make the formula in cells J-M1 repeat indefinitely across columns? i.e. as I buy more shares, if they have the dividend box ticked, their name will populate on the next column so I can start to add the dividend to the relevant month/s.

Green: when I started playing with the IF statement to check checkbox's value (dragging down for simplicity) I noticed that it skips a cell if the box is not ticked. Is there a way to avoid this so that all the names run next to eachh other? I want the names populating across columns (Yellow question) however I'm assuming the blank cell will still be a problem even then.

  
Blue: bonus q, but low priority: is there a way to simplify this coding? basically the shares account should sum all dividends that might have occured that month to the running total.

INDEX doesn't play well with that, afaik.

I get the error message: Function INDEX parameter 2 expects number values. But 'Potato' is a text and cannot be coerced to a number.

Is there a different formula I can use or a different way to format my dropdown to make INDEX work out?

Ultimate goals are --

1. Combine their multiple attempts into a single row, no matter the order. If a new person responds, they would be added to the form, but if a previous person responds, add their new answers to their row. 
2. As new responses are combined make sure to ignore the blank cells (formatted gray) and only keep the cells with text.
3. If there are multiple responses from the same person to the same question, override the old text an replace it with the new text.
4.   Ideally, check the person to see if they have zero responses and remove them. *This can be done manually, so not needed but might save time if built into the formula.*

Hi everyone!   
I have very little google sheet experience (really just started helping out maybe 3 months ago)

I am trying to pull data from a pivot table into a written table that I make graphs from.

The issue is, the pivot tables changes when new data is imported automatically (From other spreadsheet)

We have physical consultation, as well as virtual consultations (labeled as google\_conference on pivot table)

  
The simple formula is an if-and with vlookup, but I'd have to indicate which column to pull from.

The issue is, the pivot table adds a column when the information is imported, so if a virtual is booked in 10 (october) it will push ""physical"" to column 3 in my array , and ""google\_conference"" becomes ""2"".

  
I want to avoid this issue, but not sure how to get started. If I verbalize it, I would like ""if virtual has data, match it to 10 for output""

Would an Index Match work in this case? 

Thank you for any and all help!

Basically if the date in column F matches the date on the calendar (cell I5 in this case), and the task is marked as complete in column B, I want it to display a ""✔️"" (in cells H6-H9) and have it be constrained to the 4 open rows. (bonus points if you can make it show nothing if it's incomplete)

excelCopy

    =ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(FILTER(IF($B$14:$B$58=TRUE,""✔️"",""""),$F$14:$F$58=H5),4,1)

Let's break down this formula:

1. `IF($B$14:$B$58=TRUE,""✔️"","""")`: This part checks if the task is completed (TRUE in column B) and returns a checkmark if it is, or an empty string if it's not.
2. `FILTER(...,$F$14:$F$58=H5)`: This filters the results based on whether the date in column F matches the date in cell H5 (the calendar date).
3. `ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(...,4,1)`: This constrains the result to 4 rows and 1 column, fitting it into your calendar structure.

This formula will:

* Display a checkmark (✔️) for completed tasks
* Show nothing for incomplete tasks
* Only show tasks for the correct date
* Constrain the results to 4 rows

To use this formula:

1. Enter it in cell H6
2. Copy it down to H7, H8, and H9
3. Then copy these cells across to the other days of your calendar, adjusting the reference to the date cell (H5 in this case) for each column.

This solution should dynamically update as you mark tasks complete or incomplete, and as dates change. It will display checkmarks for completed tasks on the correct dates, show nothing for incomplete tasks, and stay within the constraints of your calendar layout.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1g1wag3/unsure_how_to_combine_two_separately_successful/lrjyb9g/,PostPrimary5885,2,"`=ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(FILTER(IF($B$14:$B$58=TRUE,""✔️"",""""),$F$14:$F$58=H5),4,1)","`=ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(FILTER(IF($B$14:$B$58=TRUE,""✔️"",""""),$F$14:$F$58=H5),4,1)",,,,,

In column A, I have a range of letters A, B, C, D, E, F in order

In column B, I have a range of unordered numbers: 1, 6, 5, 2, 3, 4

I would like to use a formula to re-order the range of letters in Column A to correspond to the relative value order of numbers in column B.

Example:

* 1 is the lowest number in Column B, so the Desired output is the first value in column A (""A"")
* 6 is the highest number in Column B, so the desired output is the last value in Column A (""F"")
* 5 is the second highest value in Column B, so the desired output is the second-to-last value in Column A (""E"")
* etc

Thus, the Desired outcome would be A, F, E, B, C, D.

I tried to use the SORT function for this, sort(A2:A7,B2:B7,true), but the results are totally different.

Can anyone please explain what the correct approach would be here?

googlesheets,QUERY search function with WHERE(multiple columns) or using the OR function,"I am trying to create a search bar in my sheet that searches through two separate columns (A and H) and displays any entries that contain a searched word in either of those two columns. For example, if I type ""video"" into my search bar, the QUERY function will search only the A and H columns, and if the word ""video"" is in either A or H column, it will show it as a result. The word does not have to be in both A and H column to be shown.

The only two things I could think of to make this happen are either:

=QUERY('Asset Tracker'!A1:H, ""SELECT \* WHERE 1=1"" & ""AND LOWER (A,H) LIKE LOWER('%"" &JOIN(""%') AND LOWER(A) LIKE LOWER('%"", SPLIT(C6,"" ""))&""%')"")

To break these down a bit, 'Asset Tracker' is the name of the tab with the database I want to search through. C6 is the cell I am using as the search bar. The LIKE LOWER using JOIN and SPLIT is there so I can type any combination of multiple words in the search bar and receive all results including those word. For example: I search for ""video summer"" and will only see results that have both ""video"" and ""summer"" in the title/description. So far, I've only been able to make this work with column A (title) or column H (description) separately. I need to make it so that I can search through either of those columns at the same time and get results back.

The first attempted formula I have here is just me using the ""SELECT A,H WHERE"" trick but instead moving it to after WHERE. I can't use ""SELECT A,H"" because then it only displays information from those columns in the results. Right idea, but on the opposite side of what I'm looking for. When this didn't work, I tried the second formula, which is just the formula for searching through column A and the formula for searching through column H strung together with an ""OR"" in between.

googlesheets,Referencing data from master sheet/source sheet,"Hi,  
I'm assembling a spreadsheet for fun and skill development and i could do with some advice and help with what im trying to accomplish - If you play Football manager this may interest you lmao

I have a ""master"" sheet containing every data point available for various roles, some data is common across all roles (Wages, Age, Contract expiry etc.) whilst others are specific to each role (points out of 20 in various categories, knowledge of a particular area, qualifications etc)

What i am looking to achieve is to have the data pull across from the master sheet to departmental sheets pertaining to each job spec, where the columns in the departmental sheets are relevant to the job role as well as the generic information such as Name, Wages etc

I want this to be done via Job Title, where i can assign say all rows that have ""Scout"", ""Recruitment Analyst"" as the job title are automatically populated on the recruitment sheet, pulling only the data that is required by the columns on that sheet

So for example, the Recruitment sheet would look like:

Edit: Formatting didn't like my table, i will post photo instead:

Columns A-J are consistent across all sheets, in the same order and the same what i'd call category of data (Age, Name etc)

Then there will be a range of columns containing role specific data, see example below:

(Columns K,L,M in this case are sheet specific)

So the bones of it really is, if H:H on the master sheet = Scout, fill columns A-M on Recruitment sheet with the corresponding data from master sheet, If H:H = Physio, fill columns on Medical sheet etc  - in this case, Sheet1 columns K,L,M (Judge A, Judge P & Ada) = Master sheet columns V,W,X (Judge A, Judge P & Ada)

googlesheets,Accessing Data on How Long You've Worked on Google Sheets,"**Update: Thank you for all your advice! I have utilised the Version History to at least show I spent a lot of time on it and didn't paste in large bodies of text so that is something.**



Hello! Apologies if this isn't the right place to post this, as this is technically an enquiry about google docs but I am thinking the same theory for both. Is there a way to access the data on how long you worked on a Google Doc/Sheet or track the history of changes after the fact?

For a little context, I am a Masters student and completed an assignment on Google Docs. As I completed my undergrad pre ChatGPT I have never utilised ChatGPT for assignment writing, and to be honest believe in writing my own assignments seeing I am paying thousands for my education and actually do want to learn about my topics. However, I have been flagged by the ""AI Report"" as having possible 62% AI text for my assignment. This is obviously deeply concerning as I didn't use AI at all to write my assignment and so it's a) bad that they might penalise me for something I didn't do and b) bad that their AI detection system is so poor it flags genuine work as AI.

As a consequence I feel as though I might be in a position where I have to defend my own innocence in the face of shit AI telling me I used AI when I didn't. Pretty hard to prove innocence bar just giving them my entire search history for a certain time, it is like proving your sane when people thing you're insane lol. So that leads me to my question, I did the assignment in Google Docs, can I access the data showing that I wrote this assignment over 2-3 days and spent X amount of hrs on it? I presume I wouldn't spend 15 hrs on generative text so I am hoping it aids if I get penalised. I feel as though if you can write an essay to a certain style and quality the AI detection system will flag you - sadly I would say the generative AI text systems are so good now that the people that actually use them don't get flagged and the only people punished are the ones who don't use it.

It sounds like you are hoping to let staff fill out a form that has something like their name, then a category, then a sub category based on the category? Just so they don't have to search through all the subcategories. Is that correct? 

If so, there isn't a native way to have the dropdowns within a Google Form be dynamic, but you could set it up with sections based on the categories. There is a bit of setting up, but would most likely save you time in the long run! There's probably add-ons you can download too if you want to go that route. 

**Setting Up the Form:**

What you would need is the initial staff information, then a multiple choice question with the categories names. 

You then need to make a section based on each category name. You can set up those questions with a dropdown of the subcategories and whatever question(s) you want. 

*FOR YOUR SECTIONS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF QUESTIONS IN THE SAME ORDER TO EASILY ""STACK"" DATA IN YOUR SPREADSHEET. I'll talk more on this in the ""setting up your sheet"".* 

***PROTIP****: You can setup one of the sections, then press the 3 dots of the section, then ""Duplicate section"" just adjust questions / names as needed.*

You'll then want to go back to the category name multiple choice question, press the 3 dots, and select ""Go to section based on answer"" and map the categories up with the section categories.  

Finally, you will want each category section to ""submit form"" which is an option that shows up after each section.

  
For end users, they will all have that first section, select a category, then it moves to the one section they select and submits the form after it. 

**Setting Up your Sheet:**

Each question will be its own column, so you will have 20 or more columns with many of them with empty data (since they would just fill one section each response). So the first thing you'll need to do is to ""stack"" the data. You'll ALWAYS want the initial questions to the category, then you want to stack each category response section on top of each other. I've used an QUERY() and arrays to stack it. It does really depend on your data so I cannot really create the formula for you without knowing your questions, data structure, etc.. But if they are set up with something like ""subcategory | Points "" you can combine those and the create meaningful insights from the ""master data"" like filtering by staff member, summing points, etc.. 

I know this was a lot of information, if you wanted to see sort of what I am talking about in regards to a similar project with sections, I have this longer video project where I created a Google Form for a summer camp that allowed for multiple students to be stacked together. The Setting up Form will be helpful up if you wanted to see the section components (around 8 minutes) and then the Spreadsheet setup at about 29:50. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q\_AcM5s-vwQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_AcM5s-vwQ)

Your spreadsheet would be easier since you don't have to worry about multiple responses and creating a number form how many students were signed up by family, but it'll at least show a method to get this.

googlesheets,Conditional Formatting Help,"I'm trying to create a spreadsheet that will visually identify which MLB teams have faced each other in the postseason. My sheet includes all team names in both the X and Y axes (column A and row 1). I have a source sheet in which I have each series listed out, with one column populated with the winners of each series and the next populated with the loser of each series.

So for example, cell D3 is in the Red Sox row and Yankees column. The Red Sox and Yankees have faced each other in the postseason, so there are several rows in the source that list both NYY and BOS. Given that, I'd like that cell to have a background color automatically via conditional formatting because those rows exist, whereas the one where the Red Sox and Padres would not have a background color because those two teams have never faced each other in the postseason.

googlesheets,QUERY is bizarrely treating returned Calculated Field values from GETPIVOTDATA as zeroes when it comes to formulas using series,"Hi all,

I built a GSheet dashboard at work for some clients of mine, and it's been working great. So great, in fact, that my coworker asked if I could set him up with a version for his client as well. Everything is working perfectly, with the exception of when I try to do anything with Calculated Field values that involves series. This is strange, because it's the exact same as my original dashboard (which works fine).

More context: This is basically a marketing dashboard, so an example of a pivot table field would be Spend, and an example of a Calculated Field in the pivot table would be CostPerAcquisition (defined as =Spend/Purchases). Both fields (regular and Calculated) show up fine in the pivot table, and I have a GETPIVOTDATA function to grab a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI) depending on what is selected in a dropdown menu.

`=IFERROR(GETPIVOTDATA($B$1,$AF$1,""Day"",TEXT(T2,""m/d/yyyy"")),"""")`

The above grabs the corresponding KPI (such as CostPerAcquisition, $B$1 in this case) from the pivot table (the first cell of which is $AF$1) at the desired day (T2 here). The result is a two-column table, Day and KPI, for the entire timeframe of available data. 

I have a separate two-column table that narrows the first table down to the selected start and end dates, using the below:

`=QUERY(T2:U,""SELECT * WHERE T >= DATE '""&TEXT(DATEVALUE(D1),""yyyy-mm-dd"")&""' AND T <= DATE '""&TEXT(DATEVALUE(F1),""yyyy-mm-dd"")&""'"")`

And it works perfectly and shows everything in the desired timeframe. From this second table, I have a line chart that updates itself based on whatever KPI is selected. It works fine for regular fields (such as the aforementioned Spend field), but seemingly is having issues with Calculated Fields (such as Cost Per Acquisition, or CPA). 

Even though the Calculated Fields are showing up in the table correctly, any function that thinks about them as a series treats the values as zero. For example, using SUM on Q2:Q5 results in 0, while doing Q2+Q3+Q4+Q5 results in $587.43. Since charts also use series, my chart shows up as blank whenever a Calculated Field KPI is selected.

**I have a sneaking suspicion this is related to formatting in some way**, but I've tried every combination I can think of using the source data, the pivot table data, the first table, and the second table, and I haven't had any luck. Which is extra frustrating since it works in my original dashboard. **Does anyone have any thoughts on how to get this working correctly in the new dashboard?**

Your QUERY is on T2:U, which includes all rows through the end of the sheet, is there *only* data in that range?

Your formula here is returning apparently a numeric value normally, and """" for errors, which is a text value.   So you are mixing data types.

No that isn't possible unfortunately as the grouped ""category"" lines are not actual cells. that would be a feature that would be super helpful though!

2. Remove filter from column A.
3. Reinstate filter for particular vendor in column A.

2. I added the Booth number beneath the vendor name on the first vendor sheet (green cell). This is necessary to avoid doing manual filtering.

3. I went down the list of dates in vendor sheet column H and ensured they were all the first of the month. (The ones in 2024 were not.)

4. With this setup, all of your references can be the AllData sheet (eliminating the need for the formulas sheet and the duplicating data and filtering it on each vendor sheet.

googlesheets,Conditional formatting based on the date in the header. The date should be in an interval located on another sheet.,"First of all thank you for your help! Much appreciated! 

I have sort of a calendar where people assign themselves in slots everyday (those slots are colored differently - see below).

On another sheet called *Free\_days* I have a table with the free days and periods.

What I want is to condition format and get the cells under those dates that fall in the free days intervals colored.

Basically for this example I should have range K4:K12 colored (see example below) because Oct 28 (which is formatted as a date) falls in the 28-Oct-24 - 1-Nov-24 interval. (Then again have the same condition for the next batch (Oct 8, 15, 21 and so on) and get the cells colored under Oct 29 - K14:K19).

I've tried several formulas but I don't see the error as none of these do anything:

(H$3>='Free\_days'!$A$2)\*(H$3<='Free\_days'!$B$2)

**Sorted data (ascending order):**  
With sorted data (ascending order), I know that it gives an approximate value which is less than or equal to the lookup value.  
I understand this like: VLOOKUP scans values in the first column from top onwards. If it gets the exact lookup value, it gives the corresponding output. Say, the exact value is not in the data, it will return the value corresponding to the previous row. Clean. No doubt here.

**Unsorted data:**  
My understanding of how the approximation works totally collapsed here.

If range_lookup is TRUE or left out, the first column needs to be sorted alphabetically or numerically. If the first column isn’t sorted, the return value might be something you don’t expect. Either sort the first column, or use FALSE for an exact match.

Oh, but this guy spelled it out. I kinda always wondered myself why it spewed out garbage if it wasn’t sorted.

He claims it does what’s called a binary search that basically compares the middle value of the array, then moves up or down based on whether the lookup value is larger or smaller; then continues comparing the middle value of each smaller and smaller section until it finds a match.

googlesheets,AppsScript has no permission to run in copied sheets. And I can't figure out a way to do it without scripts.,"I have a template sheet and i use googleapis and a service agent to `googleapis.googledrive.copy` hundreds of active sheets that people interact with. This worked perfectly until I needed to add a script to the sheets. Once the sheet is copied, the script Is not runnable because:

    The script cannot be run because it is owned by a service account. Please copy or transfer the project to a valid account before running.

I tried:  
- Maybe create a macro, but suffers from the same restriction  
- Transfering ownership to me via api, but ""Ownership can only be transferred to another user in the same organization as the current owner"". So overall this doesn't seem possible for us atm  
- Looked into creating some kind of a centralized script, but then i need AppsScript again to call that centralized script, so that wont work  


As the title says i ran out of ideas. My last resort is to write here and see if someone smarter than me can figure out how to do this really simple task, but without scripts.

On a single button/checkbox(or whatever interactable, I'm not picky atm) apply this to all rows:

    If E1 is ""X"" then Populate C1 with ""Y"" else do nothing

  
- I tried just simple formulas in each cell, but that would cause the formula to be lost when a manual value is inputted, breaking everything  
- I tried =ARRAYFORMULA and that actually seemed like it would work, but then it throws ""#REF!"" if there's some manual input in those fields  


This is a perfect usecase for a script, but since i can't get it to work i would appreciate any hacky ideas. If anyone can help me with either getting the scripts to work or the latter, i would highly appreciate it.

googlesheets,Bizarre issue with find and links disabled,"I am struggling with a bizarre issue that has only cropped up in the last week or so.  Googling it is useless, chatGPT's got nothing.  Here's the situation:

Suddenly, I can't search my sheets.  Command-F doesn't work. Neither does Command-Shift-H. Neither does the Edit > Find and Replace.  All are simply ignored.

At around the same time, hyperlinks stopped working. Existing ones are not clickable. I also can't create new ones; Insert Link in the right-click context menu doesn't work, nor does the Insert > Link option, or the link icon in the menu bar, or command-K. 

To make it weirder, if I go back in the history, the existing links work in previous versions, including version that were saved after this started happening, so I know the data is still there. 

It's as though the features have been secretly disabled, and I can't figure out how to undo it.  The problem occurs on every new or existing Sheets document I have in my personal Chrome profile, across the three different Macs that I own.  Even stranger, I maintain multiple Chrome profiles for work and for a couple of clubs I'm in, and this is NOT happening to any of my other Chrome profiles,, across the same three Macs. 

I'm sort of desperate; I rely on these sheets and this is killing my productivity.  Any help would be appreciated.

UPDATE UPDATE: Whoever said it was browser extensions was totally right. I had a couple of tracking-token strippers that I'd honestly forgotten about and that didn't seem to work anyway. The good news is that everything in Sheets works again and I was able to keep the extensions I needed.  Thank you to this great community!  So much better than Google forums.

googlesheets,Help with a formula to calculate sales prices,"I want to sell items for my business through a 3rd party website and they charge a fee based on the sales cost. The fees are 6% on anything below $400, and above $400, the first $400 is charged at the 6% and the rest is charged at 4%. I want to make a calculator where I plug in the in store sales price and adjusts it to include the fees charged by the website. Ideally I want the adjusted charge to always cover the fee.

Right now the way I have it setup is that Cell A2 holds 6% and A3 holds 4%.

Cell A5 is where the in store sales prices is plugged in

Cell A7 finds the fee for prices under $400 by simply checking IF A5 < 400 and if so it spits out how much the website will charge as a fee

Cell A9 finds the fee on things above $400 by just subtracting 400 from A5 then finding the fee on that and adding $24 which is essentially a flat rate on the first $400 at 6%

Ideally I would like A7 and A9 to be in a single cell instead of 2 cells and then I want another cell that will tell me how much I should charge so it will always cover the additional cost.

Select the cell you want the timestamp in, double tap the back of your phone to put the current date/time into the clipboard, then tap the cell and select Paste.

googlesheets,Need to pull ONLY bottommost value into a bar chart from a google forms response spreadsheet,"Hi friends! 

  
I am looking for some insight on chart data formulas if you have a moment! My ask is related to the one on [`this thread`](https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/15qkmi7/formula_to_select_bottommost_value_in_a_column_so/) but slightly different as I am trying to build it into a chart data input, rather than generate a number in a cell formula.



I have created a google spreadsheet where form responses are saved and I would like to generate a chart that displays the data visually but only pulls the bottommost value of the respective columns D-V. The goal of the chart is to visually display the most recent submission. I am having trouble since every time a form is submitted, the bottom most value increases by a row. 

  
Right now, chart in the spreadsheet below looks how I want it but is showing all 3 rows, rather than just the bottommost.

googlesheets,VLookup returning N/A when adding new rows of information on preexisting TTRPG character sheet with dropdown menus,"Hi everyone. I'm having a problem with a VLookup function. I'm running a Transformers TTRPG game and made a copy of a Google Sheets character sheet that someone had made. I'm updating it with some new things and something I did broke the VLookup function in cell DE82. [Here's the sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RMf-1xPfxwfrKHI9p_gwW8oTsGWkvLle8YHMn9Q3z2A/edit?usp=sharing)

Basically, this sheet has a bunch of ""Origins"" from the original core rulebook of the game. I've added some from an expansion rulebook, and plan to add more from another one. I made sure that I input the new information into the tables the exact same way that it was done on the previous entries, and then made sure they were in alphabetical order. Everything except the very first new Origin, ""Armory Call"", seems to be working just fine. However, when I select ""Armory Call"" in cell B82 of the sheet, it gives me an N/A error message.

https://preview.redd.it/ynwxacuc91td1.png?width=2222&format=png&auto=webp&s=765e1fdce7018c8e67f51050cea931e1ab20c91c

This only happens with the VLookup function referencing the OriginBenefit sheet (=vlookup(B82,OriginBenefit,2) and =vlookup(B82,OriginBenefit,3)). The others seem just fine. It seemingly fixes itself when I drag the ""Armory Call"" row below ""Champion"" or ""Cutter,"" but that breaks those two Origins in the process (makes them return the same information as ""Armory Call""). If I move it below ""Drone"" (one of the new Origins), then it breaks again. If I change the name from ""Armory Call"" to something that's not first on the list (I just did ""Insane"" lol), everything works as expected. Unfortunately, since I'm trying to reference the official rulebook material, changing the name isn't really an option, and still doesn't get to the root of the issue.

I've tried retyping the data to ensure there are no hidden characters or extra spaces, copying and pasting from the reference cell for the dropdown (which is OriginEssence), changing all the formatting to PlainText if it's not numbers, changing the name so it's not two words, adding a header to the sheet (Origin, Title, Perk), and adding ""false"" to the end of the formula. It seems to be related to the alphabetical nature of the list, but I'm not sure why that sheet is screwed up and the others aren't, and why it's just the first row.

as the title says, I'm having an issue with a script in the fifth run, which is most curious.

I have a regular Google account, no business or anything

I have a google sheets worksheet with about 6 sheets

I have a custom made Apps script I made myself, that takes the spreadsheet and copy pastes one of the existing template sheets with a new name according to some rules (basically it's supposed to create a sheet for the next month in line, so the script is super simple)

I can run this script 4 times without any issues. Four sheets are created, everything is fine. On the fifth run, I receive the following error: ""Service Spreadsheets failed while accessing document with ID"" - it's thrown in the CopyTo method.

    var copiedSheet = sourceSheet.copyTo(sourceSpreadsheet);

  
However, when I delete one of the four previously created sheets and run the script again, it creates the fourth (April) without any issues. But then on the creation of the fifth one (May), I get the error again.

I can create new sheets manually though, so it's not that. Nothing's changed between the runs, nobody else is working on the same spreadsheet.

I tried waiting a couple of hours between the fourth and the fifth run, didn't help.

I tried debugging from within the editor, it stops on the method above (+ the same behavior happens if I run it from the other as well as if I run it directly from the worksheet through a button.

googlesheets,Alternative to VLOOKUP?,"Hey experts, I need a quick advice what kind of formula I can use.

I need a formula that will look in the calendar sheet and aggregates where the project name was entered.  
The result should only aggregate the Name of the headline and all matching dates.

Here is a simple sample:

Project sheet

|Date|David|Mike|
|01.01.|A||
|02.01.|B|A|
|03.01.|B|B|

Thanks!",10/04/24 16:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1fw9yme/alternative_to_vlookup/,true_Nic,"Hi there,

In cell D2 of your worksheet ""Projects"", try:

    =byrow(A2:A;lambda(p;if(p="""";;join("", "";query(arrayformula(split(flatten(Calendar!B1:D1 & "" "" & text(to_date(Calendar!A2:A20);""dd-mm-yyyy"") & ""🪐"" & Calendar!B2:D20);""🪐""));""select Col1 where Col2 contains '"" & p & ""'"")))))

Does this generate the type of output you want?

Your regional settings require semi-colons instead of commas, which may explain why previously suggested formulae haven't worked.

To answer your specific question: for this particular solution, I have used the ""contains"" clause in the `query()`, which matches a value to a range of values (in your case, Mike having projects A, B, and D on 2024-01-19).

googlesheets,Conditional formatting error with SUMIF,"I'm hoping that someone can help as it's annoying me af!

Here's the conditional formatting formula:

**=T50-(SUMIF(M19:M49,""<=""&TODAY(),S19:S49))=0**

I'm a writer so this is a conditional formatting check to see if I have articles overdue:

* **T50** is the number of articles marked done.
* **S19:S49** is the number of articles due, broken down by each day.
* **M19:M49** is each day of the month (e.g. for October it's 1, 2, 3, etc)

The SUMIF formula says to total the number of articles with due dates up to, and including, Today's date. When I use this formula in a single cell it displays the correct number so the formula in the field works.

  
The problem I have is that despite trying $T$50, $T50, and T$50 in the conditional formula field, it only applies to cell S50.

In theory, it should highlight both cells (S50 and T50) when there is nothing overdue, and mark both as red when there is an overdue article.

This is what happens in practice... the first screenshot is when there's something overdue and the second is when nothing is overdue.

googlesheets,Rookie to Sheets (and Excel):  Trying to automatically sum only tagged rows from one column,"I'm working on a spreadsheet for logging miles on a bicycle, and I want to keep track of how long it's been since certain maintenance has been performed.

One obvious answer is to have 2 columns for distance (one for each bike), sum them both for total miles across both bikes, and sum them individually for maintenance.  (And frankly that's probably what I will do)

But I'd like to know if it's possible to tag rows in a way so that a sum can just add up the tagged rows.  That way I'd have a single column for all the miles, and then just tag them between the 2 bikes.

2. Have it so that the random selector does not pick anything where the DONE checkbox is true (I tried FILTER {NOT} but it didn't work)

3. Perhaps have a more elegant way to press a button to generate a random book/game rather than just a checkbox, including ways to pick either a random book OR a random game OR a random item from either list

You can use the below formulas to resolve parts 1 and 2 of your request. You may need to adjust the width of B accordingly.

Place in Selector!A3:

    =INDEX(Books!B:C, INDEX(FILTER(ROW(Books!B2:B), Books!A2:A = FALSE), RANDBETWEEN(1, COUNTA(FILTER(Books!B2:B, Books!A2:A = FALSE)))), 0)

Place in Selector!C3:

    =INDEX(Games!B:C, INDEX(FILTER(ROW(Games!B2:B), Games!A2:A = FALSE), RANDBETWEEN(1, COUNTA(FILTER(Games!B2:B, Games!A2:A = FALSE)))), 0)

As for elegance, you can use the below script to perform the task. Assign each function to a button:

    function selectRandomBook() {
      var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName(""Books"");
      var dataRange = sheet.getRange(""A2:C"" + sheet.getLastRow()).getValues();
      
      var filteredData = dataRange.filter(row => row[0] === false); // A column is false (not done)
      
      if (filteredData.length > 0) {
        var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * filteredData.length);
        var randomBook = filteredData[randomIndex];
        
        var outputSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName(""Selector"");
        outputSheet.getRange(""A3:B3"").setValues([[randomBook[1], randomBook[2]]]); // ** CHANGE AS REQUIRED **

googlesheets,Stock spreadsheet to track value of portfolio,"

Wondering if anybody has a tutorial on how to create a stock tracker spreadsheet which can calculate the value of your portfolio at any given time, and ideal you could have a graph which shows your portfolio value over time.I tried this by using a brute force method where I track the specific quantity of every stock/etf I’ve ever owned at every date in between when I started and now, and then by using google finance find the value of each at every date, then multiple quantity by price for each stock and then add them all up for date. This worked but I have 8000 cells worth of data and a slow spreadsheet. So I was wondering if there was a more efficient way to do this. I’m not very good at coding in sheets but I’d guess it’s possible to do this in the app script. Also I have all my transactions listed in a table on another sheet.",10/03/24 12:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1fvdf5z/stock_spreadsheet_to_track_value_of_portfolio/,Waffen_Fabrik,"If you're using googlefinance() to find the value on the date/time when you purchased each stock, then you could do it once and then use Copy / Paste Values to replace all the formulas. So then you're no longer using a formula and the values are just there.

Another thing you could try, on a second sheet use the unique() function to get a list of the stocks you have. Then use googlefinance() to get the current price. And back on your main sheet you can use vlookup with the symbol to get the current price for that stock. I don't know how much faster this would make things, if at all, but in normal development minimizing your api calls can help performance.

I made a copy and updated some of the entries with suggestions as well as created a QUERY() filter with dropdowns. 

These will be in the two M@TT tabs:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KLimj5pwBdL8vRXtf-JLfC81sF2zcT9eftwFYbMSxhU/copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KLimj5pwBdL8vRXtf-JLfC81sF2zcT9eftwFYbMSxhU/copy)

My suggestions: 

1. Have records for both male and female, not combined in the ""color""

2. separate out colors to ones like head color, beak color, etc. for more filterable options. 

  
I started what I thought made sense, but probably doing the same for Flight Characteristics would help too.  Again, the more columns of separate data, the better for being able to pinpoint. I included an all color filter as an example and may be helpful too in some cases, but just the limitation of it is all in one cell.  

  
The main formula is 

    =QUERY('M@TT_duck_Filter_data'!A2:I,""SELECT * WHERE A IS NOT NULL 
    ""&IF(C2="""",,CONCATENATE(""AND B LIKE '"",C2,""'""))&"" 
    ""&IF(D2="""",,CONCATENATE(""AND C LIKE '"",D2,""'""))&""

    ""&IF(H2="""",,CONCATENATE(""AND G LIKE '%"",LOWER(H2),""%'""))&""
     "",0)

This allows each filtering dropdown to do nothing if empty, and filter if anything has one of the dropdown.  Just note if you have more than one on, it will drill down for if it has both those conditions (vs an ""OR"" ).

I added the link / QR as I mentioned ,so if you press the link or scan the QR code (I think, I don't have a scanner) it should pull up the range H:I, so if someone scans it, then puts in a date (CTRL+; for date, CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+; for timestamp) and the I for typing crew. The other cells are still editable so you could protect the ranges so only you can edit things outside of Column H and I, and any other column(s) you want them to edit. 

  
Another thing to look into is AppSheet (Extensions > App Sheet > Create new app). You can build an ""app"" view with this spreadsheet data and then allow certain columns to be editable or viewable ranges, meaning, you can have certain information displayed and only have H and I be the edited fields for users of this ""app"". 

Another possible option is using a Google Form to collect the Date / Crew information. The only thing you would need to do is create a unique identifier for each row. If you have that or make that, you can have 3 questions: Unique ID, Date, Crew. then use a lookup function (like XLOOKUP) to search the Unique ID and pull the Date and Crew into the H and I column / row. Going back to the QR, you could (in theory) create a QR for this Unique ID and have the crew go into the form scan the QR (unique ID) for the first question as text, then enter date / crew.

googlesheets,Average reviews rating formula,"Hi guys! I'm trying to create a Google sheet where I can keep track of the reviews of a restaurant that I am managing, so I can exactly understand how many more good reviews I need to level up my average score on Google Maps.

I basically have:

631, 5 stars reviews

292, 4 stars

187, 3 stars

106, 2 stars

115, 1 stars

it adds up to an average score of 3.9, I managed to calculate how many reviews I need to get to 4.0 but i want to keep track of it so i can put some incentives in place for my waiters and knowing exactly how many more reviews we need to level up. I cannot work out how to do it as each review has a different value. I tried doing the Average Weighted formula, but I cannot make it work for this. Any suggestions please? (i had a screenshot of the basic idea)

I used the same ranges as on your sheet; this weighted avg on my test sheet agrees with you, giving 3.915.  

Edit:  Here is a formula you can put in another cell to show exactly  how many 5-star reviews at any given time are needed to bring your average up to 4-stars overall: (i currently show 113 needed). In this formula, you can change the 4 on the left next to $B$8 to whatever rating you want to hit with added 5-star reviews and it will always show that in real-time.

END GOAL: Connect a Google Form to a Google Sheet, this sheet is called *form*.

Each cell from a row on *form*, correlates to cells across several rows on *monthly data* and this data is filled out automatically with the information input from the Google Form. 

ISSUE: On the *monthly data* sheet, I am using the formula `=form!I7` then `=form!I8` in the correlating cells. I set up this formula in each cell before the information on *form* is inputted to that sheet (because the Google Form has not been filled out for that instance).

If the cell I7 on *form* is filled out, the cell with the formula `=form!I7` on *monthly data* changes to `=form!I8` and no data is automatically inputted. 

  
QUESTION: How do I get the cell with `=form!I7` to automatically input from cell I7 on *form* when the attached Google Form gets filled out.

I am hoping to count the unique instances each name appears in the column, while adding to the overall quantity the number that appears alongside.

I used COUNTIF to get the instances each name appears in the list; however, I am stuck figuring out how to add the number in the neighboring column.

googlesheets,Trying to find the frequency of certain values within a dataset?,"I created a spreadsheet to keep inventory of my nail polish with columns of various data points for each bottle (price, type, color, finish, etc). I’m trying to find out how many polishes I have of each particular color and while I’ve tried Googling and troubleshooting, I still haven’t figured out how to accomplish this as I’m a novice. 

I have multiple sheets corresponding to particular brands, but the sheet I’m looking to draw from is called “Mooncat.” I’m trying to do formula work in a separate sheet, which I’ve titled “Queries.”

I was able to use the UNIQUE function to determine how many individual colors (green, blue, red, etc) are listed within the column (Mooncat!F2:F44) and came back with thirteen colors, which are listed in Queries!A1:A13

Working in B1 on the Queries sheet, I tried the formula =FREQUENCY(Mooncat!F2:F44, Queries!A1:A13) as it’s my understanding that the formula is =FREQUENCY(data range, bins range), but it just keeps returning a single zero. I’m using a Mac and it’s my understanding that I’m supposed to do Cmd+Shift+Enter in order to run the formula as an array, but it’s still giving zero. The cells in Column F are all dropdown boxes, if that makes a difference. 

Is FREQUENCY the correct formula to accomplish this? Is there something I’m missing or entering incorrectly?

googlesheets,Organizing Data According to Dropdown Menu Selection,"Trying to create a Debt Payoff Optimizer, but running into an issue. The goal is for someone to choose from the ""DEBT PAYOFF STRATEGY"" dropdown menu and have their debts reorganized according to the strategy they selected. I have the IF functions that organize the data correctly for each strategy (shown on the right). Can't figure out how to combine them into a single equation. I tried to just combine the functions with an ""&"" but an error occurred because the dropdown menu only displays one strategy at a time (which seems to make the other functions invalid). Any suggestions for how to get this to work with a single equation? Thanks!

googlesheets,Regexreplace parentheses syntax question or alternative?,"I'm trying to get my google sheets to automatically delete parentheticals from each cell of data I have, and originally used this: =regexreplace(A1, , ""(\\s\\(.\*?\\))"",)

This worked pretty well, but I realized I do need to keep some parentheticals, so what I actually need to remove is the part of the string in parentheses if 1) the string in parentheses is above a certain number of characters (e.g., 20 characters) AND as long as it doesn't have two key words. The catch here is that each cell might have multiple parentheticals, so I need to remove everything except the shorter parentheticals and those with the keywords. 

  
Would anyone have any ideas on this? I'm not the most familiar with regular expressions, so I'm having a bit of difficulty seeing if this way is even possible. If not, is there a possible alternative.

is there an easy way to create data validations where they are selecting from a range, and then the next data validation select from a new range, and so on?

I don't know if this is possible but if it is, any help would be greatly appreciated. Also, I'm new to coding in general so the simpler the solution, the better.

It will produce up to 20 mixed sentences. The result for each separated sentence is displayed across the row. This is necessary for each sentence you add to the ""Correct Sentences"" sheet.

It;s hard to word exactly, and ive seen a lot of threads and posts talking about similar things, but never in a way that helps me. Additionally, ive heard i have to set a series of ranges (0-50, 50-100, etc) but havent figured out that either.

That is, right now, it bases the 'max' on the highest value in it, but i would hardly call 10% close enough to 100 to warrant green. Idealy, it would check how close a value is to 100 and pick the same percent of the spectrum (closer to 0 = closer to red)

googlesheets,Help with Gantt(ish) chart conditional formatting and math,"Hello,

My job entails prepping movie sets, handing them off to the production crew, and then when they are done, we wrap them. I have a Gantt chart on Sheets that I use to keep track of which dates we need to prep, which days they shoot, and which days we wrap. So far, I have been using conditional formatting to color the cells for each date depending on the text I enter into the cell. P for prep goes green, W for wrap goes red, etc.

Now I would like to get math involved. Instead of just a P, I would like to have a numerical value for each set for each day so I can sum how many workers are needed for each day.

The problem I'm encountering is that I can't figure out a way to differentiate prep days from wrap days in a way that I can do both math and conditional formatting. If I use a unique string to differentiate formats, it breaks the math. Is there a way? These schedules are constantly in flux and change nearly daily, so I would really like to do it with conditional formatting instead of manual.

googlesheets,Issue in deriving monthly value of stock in sheet android ,"Greetings everyone. I am trying to derive monthly closing price of company stock, using sheets android. I am facing challenge. Google finance function is not giving monthly closing value automatically

C1 - Month - Year, C2 - =TEXT(A2, ""YYYY-MM"") - This is to get year and month 

D1 - Month End price, D2 - =IF(C2<>C3, B2, """") - I am using this to get month end price.

googlesheets,Formula to pull specific data in one sheet to another sheet based on corresponding month in cell A1.,"I'm trying to build a metrics dashboard. I have a google spreadsheet with 2 sheets - one is the sheet with all the raw data for an entire year month by month and the other is the ""dashboard"" sheet for a current month. 

On the dashboard sheet in cell A1 I have the month name (ex. Jan). I want formulas so that it auto populates the data from the ""Jan"" month column from the data sheet. 

Here are some screenshots.

googlesheets,Listing the frequency of years from a list of dates,"Hi all, I'm looking for some help with something which is conceptually fairly simple, but since I'm not very fluent in Google Sheet I can't seem to find a way to do it.
Basically I have a column with a list of dates, I need to list of how many dates I have for each year (to use to make a chart).
Meaning, if I have three dates in 2022, one in 2023 and six in 2024, I'll need an output saying
2022 3
2023 1
2024 6

How can I do that?


A second issue I have is that some of the dates are a range, so a cell might say ""01/03/2022-15/03/2022"" and I'd need these date ranges to ""count"" as all the days included, so the example above would be 15.
From what I could see googling it I guess that date ranges can be a bit trickier than normal date, how could I deal with this?

EDIT: I'll add an example to better explain myself.
Column A is the list of dates, column D and E are what I need to be created automatically (it should also be considered that column A will be updated adding new dates in the future)

[Google Sheets Dependent Drop Down List](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=google+sheets+dependent+drop+down+list)

The short version is to create Dropdowns from a Range. Usually, the First Dropdown is based on a Fixed Range of data. The 2nd, Dependent Dropdown, will be based on a Dynamic Range (data that is filtered or sorted by criteria based on what was selected in the First Dropdown). The Dynamic Range is the key to what you're looking for, but you have to create the formula for that range. If you're going to have several ""2nd"" Dependent Dropdowns, then each additional dropdown will need their own dynamic range to be based on.

Check out the videos to give you an idea on how this works.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1folhwm/how_do_i_make_the_options_in_a_drop_down_change/loqsd8z/,gothamfury,1,,,,,,,
googlesheets,Counting Blank Cells on Column I based on background color of Column A.,"I need to count all the empty cells in a column, but with the condition that each corresponding cell in another column doesn't have these specific background colors: white, red, or orange. In other words, if cell I20 is empty and A20 is yellow, that cell is counted; if it's red, it's not counted.

The problem is that column A has merged cells, which means that if A20:25 is yellow for example, it will take A20 as yellow and the rest of the merged cells are considered as cells with a ""white"" background. I fixed this issue with this script

    function getBackgroundColor(cellRange) {
      var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
      var range = sheet.getRange(cellRange);
      var backgrounds = range.getBackgrounds();
      var mergedRanges = range.getMergedRanges();
    
      // Create an object to store background colors for all cells
      var colorMap = {};
    
      // Fill the map with the background color of merged ranges
      mergedRanges.forEach(function(mergedRange) {
        var color = mergedRange.getBackground();
        var mergedCells = mergedRange.getValues(); // Get all cells in the merged range
    
        for (var row = 0; row < mergedCells.length; row++) {
          for (var col = 0; col < mergedCells[row].length; col++) {
            var cell = mergedRange.getCell(row + 1, col + 1);
            colorMap[cell.getA1Notation()] = color; // Map each cell to its color
          }
        }
      });
    
      // Assign colors to the backgrounds based on the colorMap
      for (var row = 0; row < backgrounds.length; row++) {
        for (var col = 0; col < backgrounds[row].length; col++) {
          var cell = range.getCell(row + 1, col + 1);
          var cellNotation = cell.getA1Notation();
          backgrounds[row][col] = colorMap[cellNotation] || backgrounds[row][col];
        }
      }
    
      return backgrounds; // Returns a 2D array of colors
    }

Either way, I can't find a way to count those empty spaces. I've tried these formulas: `=ARRAYFORMULA(SUM(IF((getBackgroundColor(""A11:A"") = ""#fff2cc"") * (ISBLANK(I11:I)), 1, 0)))` but it doesn't work and gives a formula error as seen in cell G1. Cell E1 was a way to test that the script works.

I've tried other formulas to separate the conditions and see if they work individually, but the data is so large that it always returns 'Exceeded maximum execution time (line 0)'. I only know the basics of JavaScript, so I've been using AI to get some help, but it didn't work so far.

The main reason is because the custom function won't update if you change a background color in column A.

Another approach to consider is to create a new column, ""Status"" for example, that indicated the list you just shared above. For example:

* **ly - Light yellow:** Available spaces in the account
* **db - Dark blue:** Password needs to be changed
* **dg - Dark green:** Password has been changed
* **or - Orange:** Unable to open the account due to reasons beyond my control
* **rd - Red:** Account has been terminated
* <nothing> **- White:** Normal full accounts or empty columns

You can then use this column to Conditionally Format column A to display the corresponding color AND count the empty cells in column I.

For the current month : =F9-(WEEKDAY(F9-2))  (the -2 is to make the first day of the week a Monday)  
For the month of the trip : =N9-(WEEKDAY(N9-2))

The cell only needs the BT15, EX7, and BT3 from these examples. I know I could use a LEFT formula if all of them were the same amount of characters, but with some being 3 and others being 4 characters, I'm getting stuck.

Cell references: The IDs are in column D and the cell that needs the formula is column A.

googlesheets,how to check two lists of names in order to unify them with no doubles when...,"hello! let me start by saying that i'm a complete google sheets beginner - i barely know my way around a spreadsheet, so this might be a really obvious or dumb question, and for that i'm really sorry! i barely know how to explain my problem (thus the terribly vague title), but i'll try my best.

i have two long lists of full names. let's call them LIST A and LIST B. i need to check what names are on LIST A but not on LIST B, and which names are on LIST B but not on LIST A, in order to create a unified, complete list.

that's probably easy enough (although i don't know how to do that either, if not manually), right? but that's where i've ran into a problem. the problem being: the names on LIST A are complete (full and correct), while the names on LIST B are not (LIST B was made by someone else and they tended to only write down one's first and last names about 50% of the time).

example:

LIST A
- francisco machado peres
- heitor santos ramos
- maria fernanda carvalho da silva

LIST B
- francisco machado
- heitor santos ramos
- maria fernanda da silva

... if that makes sense.

so, my question is: is there still some ""automatic"" way to check what names are on LIST A but not on LIST B, and which names are on LIST B but not on LIST A, in order to create a unified, complete list... or am i doomed to do it manually?",09/22/24 13:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1fmzsqt/how_to_check_two_lists_of_names_in_order_to_unify/,stardroplia,"Hello, I made a [Demo Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19s6mFFcNhwbbaPbUmyKgU_RYCAoq178MsHm91lSBerI/edit?usp=sharing) that you can use to get you started. It assumes that List A is in column A starting with row 2, and List B is in column B starting with row 2. The formula in cell D2 finds names in List B that are not in List A. The formula in cell F2 adds the names in column D to List A. The combined list in column F is sorted to help you visually find names that may be the same name, due to a typo, or misspelling.

This is how the formula in cell D2 works:

* It filters List A by the first name of each whole name in List B.
* If a match is not found, the whole name (from list B) is added to column D.
* If one or more matches are found, then it checks if the rest of the name (middle, last) exists in each of the found matches.
   * If ALL the names (first, middle, last) are NOT found in any of the List A matches, the whole name (from list B) is added to column D.
   * Otherwise, it is assumed that the name in List B is a partial match for the name found in List A.

**You can Make a Copy of the Demo Sheet**. Delete the test names in columns A & B. Then Paste your List A names into column A and Paste your List B names into column B.

You can then **COPY** column F and in another column, **PASTE VALUES ONLY**. This will fix the data as values that you can process as needed.

What this does is: first check if column C is blank, if so output nothing, then check if column Bs text has 3 or more characters, if so output column B, if not put x’s in front of the text until it has 3 digits. Then check if C has 6 or more digits in it, if so output C with an ! after it, and if it is not then put 0’s in front until it has 6 digits and put an ! after.

googlesheets,"Trying to COUNTA(FILTER()) multiples ranges of data, selected from a DROPDOWN box, with a single formula works for some ranges and not others. Fixing the broken ranges breaks the previous working ones","I'm hoping that title works.



**SHEET 01**

I keep track of the movies I watch. Each row is a single movie entry, where there are like 10 columns of data per movie; DateWatched, Title, Genre - that kind of stuff.

Yes, I am aware databases exist. No, I will not change to one.

Each column is set up as a Named Range. Half of the columns take DropDown input only. 2 of those DropDowns take multiple options (eg. you can pick more than one Genre per movie, I limit myself to choose 2 max).

**SHEET 02**

I have a dropdown box that has 3 options:

* Genres (eg. Action, Drama, Horror, etc.)
* MediaTypes (eg. DVD, Bluray, Theater, etc.)
* Certifications (eg. PG, PG-13. R, etc.)

When you choose one, the cells below the dropdown populate with the full range of that particular choice. The ranges for each are different sizes, and I don't care what those sizes are. So, choosing ""Genres"" in A1 puts 'Action' in A3, 'Adventure' in A4, 'Comedy' in A5, all the way to 'Western' in A21.

Next to each of those items, I want to count the number of movies with that attribute from SHEET 01. Back in the day, I would use COUNTA(FILTER(FilmTItle, Genre=A3)) in B3 and drag that down to the needed cells.

Recently, I became aware of BYROW(), which I've taken to immediately.

In this case BYROW(A3:A21, LAMBDA(category, COUNTA(FILTER(Genre, SEARCH(category, Genre))))). 

Here is where my problem starts to appear. 

I have to use SEARCH()/FIND() in this filter with Genre since it's stored as ""GENRE01, GENRE02"". For example, if I'm searching for 'Horror', it needs to treat films labeled as just 'Horror' the same as a film labeled 'Horror, Comedy' and the same as one labeled 'Drama, Horror'. They should all be just +1 to the 'Horror' category. 

However, if I go and switch the DropDown to 'Certification' then this Filter() breaks. When it SEARCH() for the rating G, it's picking up the capital G in PG, PG-13 and anything else with G. The rating R also counts anything that is 'Not Rated' (but doesn't pick up Unrated). If I switch the SEARCH()/FIND() to just an = operation/EXACT(), then it works correctly. But then that obviously breaks the previous stuff with Genre.

  
I've put together a [Test Version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15qwy0hdXWLGSkK2asPLqxJ2JBJXf3Ux8LLjVCIpx8Vw/edit?usp=sharing) of this with some real data that hopefully better explains the problem. 

  
**Possible solutions**

1. Split the Genres into multiple columns (2). I use to have it this way but I love the look of the single column.
2. Add an IF() to check to see which DropDown option is selected and change the FILTER() based on that. This could get very ugly and large quickly. More so if I decide to add more options to the DropDown.
3. VLOOKUP()/Pivot Tables - just no </s>
4.

So looking at the first photo, we are testing a bunch of different parameters (Columns C-K) in our aquariums and I'm hoping for a formula that will pull specific data points from the data sheet based on the date the parameter was checked, the parameter itself (i.e. salinity) and for the correct aquarium it was tested for. So starting with our system CWN, I currently want to pull the two data points (arrows) in Column L into the two empty cells on the Water Quality Sheet. The formula will have to meet the Criteria of it being Salinity in Column B (data sheet) and match the date found on the Water Quality sheet. The goal is that as we enter information into the app and the information populates into the data sheet, that the correct parameters will go into the correct spot based on the date it was taken. We currently have 16 aquariums, so that's 16 tabs that we are hoping to pull information into. Hoping for a code that we can just drag down since changing the formula for every cell for every parameter and system would be less efficient then us manually entering the information.

There is just one thing I'm desperately trying to add. Hopefully I make sense here. I will use Person One as this example, in the rest of the spreadsheet I have several people I also want to do this for.

The way I've set it up is when Person One is selected in column D, the amount they owe will add up under ""person one total"". This is the formula I am using that works in cell H10:

=SUMIF(D9:D34,""PersonOne"",E9:E34)

I just want to edit this formula so when the ""paid individually"" column (F) is ""TRUE"", it subtracts the corresponding row amount in column E for a true total unpaid. This is so that way if something is paid individually, it is removed from the total amount owed leaving us with the total unpaid. This is the equation I attempted but it seems I need to specify more, because this equation subtracts from each persons total:

=SUMIF(D9:D34,""PersonOne"",E9:E34)-SUMIF(F9:F34,""TRUE"",D9:D34)

Hi everyone,

I'm building a table that shows how many times I have rolled each result on a die, and looking for a way to count the results (right column), and return results in terms of the die value (left column), to find the average, median, and mode dice rolls

I keep a master list of patient visits by facility.  I'll use row 15 (the first row of the patient list) as an example:

Cells G15 contains the date of the last encounter with the patient and feeds a corresponding cell in another worksheet.  I typically see patients twice monthly.  Cell H15 contains the date of the second visit with the patient for the current month.  Cell I15 contains the first visit with the patient for the current month.  Each month I add two cells to the left the current month.  These cells then become H15 (second visit) and I15 (first visit) and the previous month becomes J15 (second visit) and K15 (first visit) and each previous month is moved into the next two sets of cells (L15 and M15 and so on).  

Each of these cells feed various other cells that I use to track data for scheduling next visits, invoicing my employer, reporting productivity, etc. so I can't simplify the sheet more than I already have.  My sheets and the formulas, cell references, etc. I've built are pretty complex so I can't really move cells or columns around without creating chaos.

I never purge patients from the list and only designate them as inactive or discharged because sometimes they return to the facility or resume care under my service.  Also, some patients aren't available to be seen for one or the second visits for the month and the cells are empty.  I have conditional formatting in place that colors the empty cell yellow so I have an easy way to see patients that have not been seen any or for the second visit for the month so, when the month ends, I fill the cell with ""---"" to designate no visit and to clear the cell fill color.  

In the example, the patient name is in cell C15.  All patient names are in this column - active, inactive, and deactivated - and are denoted by no fill, pink (inactive) and gray (deactivated).  If they're inactive or deactivated, I won't have seen them for any of the visits that would be recorded in the new cells in columns H and I that correspond to their row so two new blank cells are created and both ultimately filled with ""---"" so there will be text in the cell and the cell won't be colored yellow instead of pink or gray like the rest of the row.

In the sample spreadsheet, I need to retain the value in cell G15 so I know when I've seen the patient last (even for inactive or deactivated patients).  I'd like to have the same formula for each cell in column G beginning with G15 so it will input the value from, for example, I15 if H15 is blank or is ""---"", from H15 if it contains any date, or will search horizontally beginning with cell H15 and fill cell G15 with the value of the next cell that contains a date (value is not ""---"" and cell is not blank).  If none are found value should be ""NA.""

I know this was a long explanation.  I've included a link to a sample page that should be clearer.  The formula in cells G15:G45 is working as designed.  I need to add another condition to that formula that will not fill the cell with ""---"" and will instead search horizontally and fill the cell with the value of the first cell it comes to that contains a date.  If no date is found, then fill the cell with ""NA.""  I have what I came up with in  cells G45 and G46.  Neither value is what I want there.  G45 should be ""NA"" and G46 should be ""08/15/2024.""

However, I think you could solve you problem by either faking the render, with pattern matching, or something else. Here are some ideas:

• Faking the render: use something like SUBSTITUTE to replace tags with what they would display. For example, <li> could be replaced with • (this is obviously a simplification and the correct substitutions would probably requite some thought.

• You could also look for empty tags such as <li></li> -- look for what you don't want instead of trying to render what you do want.

• Remember that you can do this in steps, it doesn't need to be one huge formula. For example, first check to see if the text starts and ends with <ul> tags and remove them (so the text without the <ul> tags appears in a new cell) then do another operation. You can do lots.

• Pattern matching: use regular expressions or another method of pattern matching to find text patterns you either do or don't want. All you really need to do is eliminate text that is good, or find text that is bad.

• Another option would be to use an HTML checker, people have coded those already and they are available online for free.

We currently use a manual spreadsheet where we track how many are submitted by each client, each day, for each weekly pay period. There is one spreadsheet for each week of the year, number as 01WK 02WK all the way through 52WK. We also include comments for each day to keep track of progress for ongoing projects. I’m trying to automate this spreadsheet by using our submission log to autofill the spreadsheet (obviously not the comments, we will still add those) so the quantities are calculated without us having to enter the info into multiple places. I have figured most of it out but my main issue is that I want to be able to create each weeks sheet ahead of time and already have it formatted with the dates needed (Monday of the pay period through Wednesday of the following week, though Saturday-Wednesday will be grouped together in a weekend column) and a full list of clients, even if they have no submissions for the week, with zeros in place until a submission is entered into the log.  

I’ve tried a couple of different things and the pivot table worked best but to have the comment sections I had pull info from the pivot table into another spreadsheet, which I’m fine with if it works properly but the main issue I’m running into is not being able to list the clients who haven’t submitted anything and listing future dates in the pivot table.

I am open to code, but I’m very new to it so would need more help than is generally provided in my searches. 

Spreadsheet info: 
Log is where we list everything in order it’s received. We do not want to change this format, it works well for us as is. Column B is the pay period I want to filter by, Column I is the client names I need listed and column C is the date we want them sorted under. Column N is a unique identifier if needed for counting purposes but none of the other info in the sheet needs to be referenced in the tracker.

No problem! I’m sure you set it up properly, but I’ve also included a photo of a test I just made, that way you can compare & maybe catch something.

The formula =FILTER(Carrot!A2:P,Carrot!G2:G<>””) should work, G2:P (rather than G2:G) would give you an error because it can only look for conditions in one row/column at a time.

Often parse errors are silly things like formatting, so I’d double check you’re using straight up & down quotation marks rather than curly ones. Deleting any spaces (even though sheets is usually pretty accommodating), & as a final check maybe type the formula elsewhere & paste it in using ctrl+shift+v (pasting that clears formatting).

If it's not too much, I would appreciate if you can include the instruction of how you do it so i can have the knowledge in case i do something similar to this again. Thank you :)

Your example is a bit confusing, to be honest so let me try to generically answer.

Your final cell (where you want the computation) is where you'd be writing your formula.  
Then go piece by piece.

We start with your first number, A2 so =A2  
Now it sounds like you want A3 to actually represent an increase of 9 (109%)?   
If you want it to be an increase you would say =A2+((A3+100)/100)  
This says 500 + ( ( 9 + 100) / 100). You could also simply say ((A3 / 100) + 1) or even just A3/100 + 1 (the parenthesis make it easier to visualize but if you follow order of operations it's not necessary.  
You do the same with A4 and however many you would like. Since you're multiplying, order doesn't matter so saying (500 \* 1.09 ) \* 1.22 is the same as 500 \* 1.3298 so you can multiply wherever.

Edit. The search uses exact names so if you change the list or the dropdown it will break. The best way to do this is to make the dropdowns, “dropdown from a range “ and set the range as the list of companies from the data tab.

googlesheets,Drop down /checkbox formula validation over several tabs and cells,"Hello All,

I've been trying to work on this on my own looking at reference material for several days now and just can't find a solution that works the way I want. Here is the [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rNkivXrEGIlGdT9IMqg456N5qRarwnO0ldJs6UTFD10/edit?usp=sharing) I am working on. It is in its very early stages and is very messy so I apologize. I have highlighted the areas I am asking about in blue.

In the first tab there are two drop down cells. These are functioning fine and pull data from the fourth tab, column A.

The second tab has the cell where I am trying to put the formula in question: C9. It has a Frankenstein of a formula in there right now that is just a mess.

The third and fourth tabs have the same data that will be used in the formula but the third tab has the data consolidated for ease where the fourth has the data mixed with ALL of the other data for the drop downs on the first tab.

So the issue I am having with the formula on tab two;  I want it to check the two drop downs on tab one, if one or both of those drop downs have the values listed in the third tab then it resolves in ""True"". If the two drop downs don't have any of the values it resolves in ""False"".

In a perfect world I can do away with the third tab and just pull the data from the fourth tab but If having an extra tab to make the formulas easier to write i'm fine with that.

Any help with this would be super appreciated. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.",09/13/24 20:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1fgb5a4/drop_down_checkbox_formula_validation_over/,DJWildebeest,"Hi,

I have few questions:

1. Will you always have only these 5 names in tab3 to check against? OR Is there a criteria to pull that 5 names? This will help me to get rid of tab 3. I have assumed those values are fixed and not used tab 3.
2. If EITHER of D13 or E13 is present in the list of those 5 names from sheet-Sets by buff, then TRUE or FALSE. Do you want this output? If yes, why do you have checkboxes in the column then?
3. Your formula says Gate is Closed, but your posts says output has to be either TRUE OR FALSE.

googlesheets,Adding together values from a conditional drop down,"Hi,

I am making a spread sheet where there are 2 rows with 2 separate dropdowns, these drop down have multiple choices and then

Ive linked my spreadsheet, in the middle i want to add the values from the calibration attribute row and move them to their selected location at the bottom if it exists.

For example, i have ""Crit Rate"" as an option on the left, and the drop down list has Crit rate as a choice for the first and the second. How would i be able to create it so that if a person picks crit rate for the top, or crit rate for the bottom, or crit rate  in both slots, that it will move the value to the row b9, or if need be, add the values of the first and second calibration and then move it to the crit rate row of B9?

So to be clear, i would want B9 to reflect the value of D5 or D6 or D5+D6 if both options chosen are Crit rate, but if neither option is crit rate, id just want to make it 0.

Sorry if this is inappropriate, i am new to sheets.

googlesheets,Autofill based on two dropdowns,"Screenshots provided and thank you in advance!

**Q**: Is there a formula which can autofill *column E* according to the *dropdown options selected in columns C & D* using the following *matrix*?

**What are the options available in the different dropdowns (screenshot 1)?**

Options available on dropdown column C (task size): S, M, L, XL

Options available on dropdown column D (deadline): W-M, M-Q, Q-H, H-Y

This corresponds with the options in the matrix: Small - XLarge and Week-Month - Half-Year

**It appears that these are 2 different tabs (what are their names)?** 

Correct, but (if possible) my preference is not to use a two tabs to be able to execute the formula. Screenshot/tab 2 which shows the matrix is only used to illustrate the possible outcomes.

**Also what  do you want in column E based on the selections?**

Essentially, in screenshot/tab 1, what I want is: *if column C = S, and column D = W-M, then, column E = Critical* ....and so on -- according to the matrix in screenshot/tab 2.

**Context**: my brain can't prioritise if there's no reference to effort/time required. I've created this table but I'm struggling with automating the priority column. I don't want to keep referring to the matrix to figure out how important a task is. Tasks are, of course, for example only.

I've assumed that form responses are in a sheet called ""raw data"".

You can use `=IF(COUNTIFS('raw data'!$B$2:$B, $A2, 'raw data'!$C$2:$C, B$1) > 0, ""X"", """")` in `B2` of your output sheet and drag this *across* **and** *down* as required.

Alternatively, a *slightly* cleaner approach could be to use `ARRAYFORMULA` in the header row of the output sheet. Place the below...

    =ARRAYFORMULA({""Friday"";
    IF(COUNTIFS('raw data'!$B$2:$B, $A2:$A, 'raw data'!$C$2:$C, ""Friday"") > 0, ""X"", """")})

It sounds like you are asking for a function that will display, in A1, a count of all cells in C that are not formatted with strikethrough and you'd like this to update whenever the sheet is edited, including formatting modifications?

To achieve this, you can use an onChange function. You'd first need to run the `createOnChangeTrigger` function from within the editor to set up the trigger.

As the title states. I thought I would be able to use two criteria for an index and seems to argue with itself and try pointing at two different cells when I try.

I am attempting to track best records and worst records, but I've come across the issue of ties and wanted to use a second criteria to differ to when this inevitably happens while constraining the code to one cell... (I really like the clean look of avoiding multiple cells and multiple sheets, sorry)

My current code is as written:

    =INDEX({$N$3:$N$10},MATCH(MAX($O$3:$O$10),{$O$3:$O$10},0),MATCH(MAX($P$3:$P$10),{$P$3:$P$10},0))

Which returns

    Function INDEX parameter 3 value is 6. Valid values are between 0 and 1 inclusive.

So theoretically it should be Indexing the Player Name and Win %,  then PF value if multiple tie.

I think ultimately, yes just changing the format. I think usually it goes by numbers as default. I may be off on that.

If you are fine with it being text (vs a number) you can use TEXT() to format numbers as a certain way:

For example, if you have a date/number in C3, you can use:

    =TEXT(C3,""mm - mmmm"")

To get the same format you have.  I *think* if you add it to your formula like this:

    =ARRAYFORMULA(TEXT(IF(A4:A<>"""",VLOOKUP(G4:G,CALENDAR!C4:G15,5),)),""mm - mmmm"")

It may be the wrong place in it, however. If it comes up an error.

googlesheets,Is it possible to use Conditional Formatting to set the color of text inside a dropdown menu?,"[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MdPbMJnnSW2MvCT12nS3zdfyZs3T4MAJAf1hlBHjXeA/edit?gid=2100307022#gid=2100307022](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MdPbMJnnSW2MvCT12nS3zdfyZs3T4MAJAf1hlBHjXeA/edit?gid=2100307022#gid=2100307022)

I have been trying to figure out how to do this but I can't seem to solve it. In the example sheet, I have cell B5 set as a dropdown menu, with the three options set as Example 1, Example 2, and Example 3. There is Conditional Formatting applied to cell B5, all of which are ""When text is exactly"" and then each set to look for Example 1, Example 2, and Example 3. The Conditional formatting is set to change the background color of the cell, and the font color in the cell.

I can see the cell background changing behind the dropdown menu, and when I double click the cell the text changes to the correct color, but when the cell is just displaying the dropdown menu text the font color isn't what Conditional Formatting is set to change it to. Is this because the text is not exclusively inside the cell, but rather inside a dropdown menu inside the cell? If so, is there a way to change the color of the text inside the dropdown menu depending on which option is selected?

Thanks for reading, I appreciate it!",09/11/24 12:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1fegjqf/is_it_possible_to_use_conditional_formatting_to/,Xaqory,You can’t do what i think you want. You can manually color the options on a dropdown within the data validation tab. You can also use conditional formatting to change the cell background color based on an option selected. But there is no way to conditionally format the dropdown color with native functionality. If you are ok with presetting the colors. Then you can set each option to a color ahead of time within data validation.

Hi everyone! I know a few people have created name generators on Google Sheets/Excel. I'm trying my hand at making a ""Generic Midwest Convention Generator,"" complete with introductory phrases for the tagline and over 300 cities. I'm not very experienced with it.

The rough logic is represented in the image above:

Pick 1 introductory phrase from the column on the phrase sheet, preposition 1 (at), 1 fest name from the relevant sheet column, preposition 2 (either ""at"" or ""in, also written into a column on the appropriate sheet), 1 location from the relevant column in the location sheet, preposition 3 (in), and 1 city from the city column in the relevant sheet.

[\[The Index of Sheets\]](https://preview.redd.it/qxmk6gsse1od1.png?width=2186&format=png&auto=webp&s=03dd74ad2979b827286e15d2a2f1faf2a622978c)

The result, in a text box, would assemble something like this:

""What's up stream, today we're"" ""at"" ""the Naruto-Run 5k"" ""in"" ""the basement of a shut down Staples"" ""in"" ""Cleveland, North Dakota.""

I understand that I can use the following formula to randomly pick a name from the sheet:

=INDEX(A:A,RANDBETWEEN(1,COUNTA(A:A)),1)

However, I am trying to make a text box that will combine all of the above elements to create a phrase in one text box. If any of you can point me in the right direction, I would be grateful.

googlesheets,Rows of sheet referenced to another sheet repository of Google Form responses.,"Hello.

I am meaning to define a data table in one sheet (1) by referencing its cells to another sheet (2) which contains data from Google Form responses. The result I am looking to achieve is that row 1 of sheet (1) must correspond to row 1 of sheet (2), and so with the rest of the rows. For example:

     Sheet (1) cell A5
           =Sheet2!$C5

Apparently, for each Google Form response, an additional row is ***inserted*** to sheet (2). Say, the latest response causes insertion of new row 5 in sheet (2). Because it is ***inserted***, the reference made as shown above becomes:

     Sheet (1) cell A5
           =Sheet2!$C6

The same is true even if I use absolute referencing as to the row.

Because of this, I need to manually update the rows in sheet (1) everytime a response is added in the repository, sheet (2).

|Dwigt Schrute|
|:-|
|Assistant regional manager-Dunder Mifflin-Scranton|

you would need to add `|\-` to the regex string to specify `-` as another valid delimiter. However, this will cause issues because `-` is also used elsewhere in the dataset as a non-delimiter character, so while Dwigt would get the proper split Omar Mansur would end up with

Hopefully the IMAGE above explains my requirements, but essentially I am trying to use a FILTER with CHOOSECOLS on a seperate sheet (within same workbook) to only return  2 columns (B & C in this example, but there could be data in between) from sheet 1 only when PERSON2 is NOT the ""OWNER"", but *is* a SUBOWNER somewhere within the other columns D to K (apologies col headers missing).

So in the example above, would be hoping to return the following data:

**PLACE  /  OWNER**  
PLACE A - PERSON1

It would ignore the second row because PERSON2 is the ""OWNER"" and it would ignore row 3 because PERSON2 is not found within the array of data on that row.

Thank you very much in advance",09/10/24 9:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1fdiwp6/help_with_filter_based_on_multiple_criteria/,Mundane-Feature9668,"FILTER( sheet1!B:C , sheet1!C <> ""PERSON2"" , (sheet1!D:D=""PERSON2"") + (sheet1!F:F=""PERSON2"") + ... )

To make this work, a lookup table is needed with the lower limits for each range, and then xlookup() or similar can be used to find matching values. The essential part is the final argument of xlookup() for match\_mode; I have used -1 for ""an exact match or the next value that is lower than the search\_key"".

I changed your values table in K7:O12 therefore to have the lower limits for each range. Depending on the value of the drop down, we filter the table so that we look up the row of data for that dropdown value.

I used the map() lambda-helper function in H8 to calculate the BMI and avoid divide-by-zero errors:

    =map(F8:F47,G8:G47,lambda(b,d,if(or(b="""",d=""""),,sum(b/(d^2)))))

I used the byrow() lambda-helper function in I8 for the xlookup:

    =byrow(H8:H47,lambda(b,if(b="""",,xlookup(b,filter(K7:O12,K7:K12=C5),K7:O7,,-1))))

You can see this working when you change the dropdown from ""8 TAHUN"" to ""9 TAHUN"" - the BMI value of 20 for Bil 10 (in row 17) changes from ""Obes"" to ""Berat berlebihan"" because ""Obes"" in ""8 TAHUN"" is >=19.7 whereas ""Obes"" in ""9 TAHUN"" is >=20.5.

Removed my head from the brick wall long enough to finally just ask for help. 

I've written the following formula to look for a Last Name, First Name and attendant value in two different sheets of a [workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DDejKK42kIjY5hWDCHljtLuZxmFfSsZQdeUbAXF04ug/edit?usp=sharing) (sample with dummy data) and return a 1 if either condition is met, and """" if neither condition is met.

Great so far. Problem arises when the second Vlookup fails to find the Last Name, First Name value in the second sheet. Regardless of whether it's found it in the first sheet (and it always will, as it's a master list), the formula returns #N/A. No problem, I thought, I'll wrap the whole formula in ISNA and set that to return """". But that resulted in """" returned even when 1 should have been returned (because the first condition was met. 

The second Vlookup is going to encounter a lot of not-founds, but replacing the pivot table with a static list is not possible given the way the form that collects the data is set up (and that is out of my control). If possible, I'd like to keep the solution as close to the original formula as possible as I will not be the owner of this sheet forever.

Then you can use this formula to create a helper column in the price table: `=B4&"", ""&A4` and drag it down the column.

Then, in the Wholesale Price column, you'll use: `=XLOOKUP(C2,'Wholesale Prices'!E:E,'Wholesale Prices'!C:C,,0)` and (you guessed it) drag it down the column.

*Note: there are formulas to spill this down an entire column, but I've used formulas that are more straightforward so they'll be easier to troubleshoot in the future if needed.*

It looks like you use a wide variety of terms for the same thing in your product listings rather than using consistent terminology / naming conventions. *(Example, some use XX-Large and others use 2XL)*  This will make any lookup (like `XLOOKUP`) problematic. If you want to use formulas to do this work for you, you'll need to have your data be consistent. The best strategy from this point is:

1. add all the missing variations to your price table to ensure there's a match for each of the products currently in your products table. You'll know you need to add the variation because the price won't appear in column B of your product table
2. revise your product listings themselves so they are uniform. In the future, you won't need to continue adding variations to your price table.

I'm currently trying to create a table of places across the alphabet and I want to pick 10 entries from that list and show them in a seperate output list. The list is quite hefty because it is on a second sheet and A3:Z1166 big with quite a bit of blank space. If anyone wants to see the list I can link it if needed, there's nothing personal on there.

I have been searching on the internet already for such a function and a solution I found is this set of functions.

>=ARRAY\_CONSTRAIN( UNIQUE( SORT( FILTER( FLATTEN(A2:C5), FLATTEN(A2:C5)<>""""), RANDARRAY( COUNTA(A2:C5), 1), TRUE)), 5, 1)

I tried that but I can't seem to get it entirely correctly. I searched in both my native language and english and I'm reasonably sure from the examples I've seen that it should work.

What it is supposed to do is that it should define the list, flatten the columns into a one column wide list, pick out doubles, ignore blank cells and then pick random entries but despite the explanations I've seen so far I've not been successful in adapting the formula to my list.

I hope this is sufficient enough that the community can help me. If anything is needed, I can try to answer additional questions.

Then if you change the student name in C2 of the student sheet, you should see the evaluation type change to match the student name.

The formula here is longer than your current one, but the benefit is you can make a copy of your sheet and only need to change the student name to have the correct data pulled.

googlesheets,Formula for whether a group of rows is active or pending as of today,"This is part of a larger sheet but I'm reducing this specific issue to the bare bones. It's not about work dates at all, but let's pretend we're looking at crew work dates in a company where people only ever start work, but the end date is never registered (at least not in this sheet), and I need to tell if I'm looking at the last version of a work crew.

I have [a sample sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wVTxZxF9EtafJ7MHWUd1cc6xgeB31GhhaJU4TkSFis0/edit?gid=2100307022#gid=2100307022) with two date columns; one (A) has the date that work paperwork was submitted, and the other (B) has their start date. C has the workers' names, and D has the crew they were assigned to. People always join crews on the same date, so crew Alpha might hire 10 people on January 1st and another 15 on February 2nd. It's possible for two crews to hire people on the same date. It's not possible to onboard only one person at a time, it's always in groups of 10 or more (but the sheet has them in 2s or 3s for simplicity).

**I need three more columns:** E (which I already have) determines whether this iteration of the crew is okay to work today because their start date is today or earlier (`=B2<=TODAY()`). Column F would determine if this is the last update to this crew, even if their start date hasn't passed. Column G would determine if it's the last iteration of this crew that also can work today, so a combination of E and F.

Honestly I keep getting overwhelmed because my instinct is that I'd need to use vlookup but I don't know how I should be going around comparing things to themselves in order to get the last iteration, let alone filtering it so it applies to the entire crew rather than a singular row.

My sample sheet has a ""Build Sample"" sheet and an additional ""What I want"" sheet. The additional one doesn't actually have formulas at all for columns F and G, but it shows what I want since I know it reads sort of confusing.

I’m new to Google sheets and don’t know how to do anything so I really need help and the answer to be simplified as much as possible if there is one😅 so basically im creating a list for my TBR and I want my columns to be “book name” “author” “genre” “series name” etc and I used the template To Do list which has the option to sort the column alphabetically which is fantastic, the only problem is that when I do this, the row with each information gets separated so if I sort book name alphabetically, it’s no longer attached to its authors etc. Is there a way to keep my rows together so when I sort one column, say author alphabetically then the whole row moves rather than the single cell in that column?

googlesheets,How to average multiple columns while ignoring ones that are blank,"Hi! I want to find my accuracy percentage by day and by category for a test I’m studying for. I am taking the amount of correct answers (#C) and dividing by the total questions (#T) minus the questions I didn’t attempt because of time constraints (#UN). [C/T-U)]. There are two categories: Logical Reasoning (LR) and Reading Comp (RC) that make up 4 sections. Any given test will have either 3 LR sections & 1 RC or 2 LR and 2 RC. I’m trying to find my accuracy for all LR sections from one test and accuracy for all RC sections. My current formula for LR is 

=AVERAGE(F3/(E3-H3), J3/(I3-L3), R3/(Q3-T3))
*the numbers in the formula correspond to the rows
However, this only works if the test I took has three LR sections. Otherwise it shows an error because it tries to divide by zero. The same issues arises with my RC formula which is currently:

=AVERAGE(N3/(M3-P3), V3/(U3-X3))

How do I add an if not blank condition? Putting “<>” at the end of the formula isn’t working. (Rows after 8 can be ignored because I know it’ll be an error not matter what until I add my new scores each day)

I'm hoping there is a way to paste a url into a cell, and have that url be parsed to create a hyperlink in the same cell. I have a lot of links that I need to keep track of, and I'm trying to keep them readable by changing them to hyperlinks.

As a small example, if I were to keep a list of subreddits and I paste **https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/** in cell B1 it would automatically change it to **=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/"", ""googlesheets"")** in cell B1. 

Example of how it currently lays out in cells:
___

    C1: =HYPERLINK(B1, A1)
___
And I'm hoping to put the value for C1 back into A1.

googlesheets,Formula not recognizing date in date range?,"I am trying to get data from one sheet to populate a column in the other sheet and it's only pulling one result for all rows.

Here's what I need the formula to do. You can reference along with the screenshots provided below:  
I need to write a formula in Google Sheets to auto-populate Column K starting in cell K2 in MASTER sheet with the value from column H in FUSU MATRIX sheet based on the date entered in Column A starting in A2 from MASTER sheet. For example, if the date in Column A MASTER sheet falls within the date range starting in Column E FUSU MATRIX sheet and ending in Column F FUSU MATRIX sheet, the value that will populate in Column K MASTER sheet will reflect the value from Column H FUSU MATRIX.

This is the formula I am currently trying to use that seems to only want to produce a single result for each line, regardless of the date entered:

    =ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A2:A="""", """", IFERROR(INDEX('FUSU MATRIX'!H:H, MATCH(1, (A2:A >= 'FUSU MATRIX'!E:E) * (A2:A <= 'FUSU MATRIX'!F:F), 0)), """")))

At first glance when I enter the formula in MASTER! K2, it looks like it's working, however the % value should change when the date changes from 8/16/2024 to 8/19/2024 on some rows, and so on with other dates.  It is only pulling the value from Row 3 in FUSU MATRIX! and nothing else... and I cannot figure out WHY.

What could be causing the formula to only pull one result for all lines?  Is there a different formula I should try?  I am only open to add-on's or anything else if a formula is not required here, or this can be done another way.

googlesheets,How do i remove names from a drop down once they have been used.,"In the linked document, on the ""Assignment Matrix"" page I have a list of names that I add to as people volunteer. 

On the ""Black Belt name list"" page, I created a sort of list to alphabetize it. (this page is hidden from the user)

I created dropdowns on the ""Assignment Matrix"" page using data validation.

I want the names removed from the drop-down lists once they are assigned a position. 

I would also like the name to re-populate on the list if they are subsequently unassigned  


(Note: I am OK with the invalid data warning after the name is removed--i just can't figure out how to remove the name)

In the range of B, there may be consecutive entries, and for those instances that there are consecutive entries, I just want to count those entries as 1 for the '***COUNTIF***' part of the formula.

I will give you an example, say the range of ***'Sales Log'!$B$4:$B,*** is as follows:

B  
X  
X  
X  
C  
C

googlesheets,Is there any way to take variables and add the amount of variables in the last column (explained below) ,"Hi! I’m a manager of a business and I use sheets to make weekly schedules. September is a slower month for the business and a lot of our staff go back to school this month/are under 18, so I need to be careful of how many hours/shifts they get per week due to labor laws!

For example, the employee in the second row is at position ‘d’ on Sunday night and they don’t have any other shifts. In the far right column in their row, it would pop up ‘1’ and if I added another shift it would automatically pop up ‘2’.

googlesheets,Applying UPPER to IMPORTRANGE generates a newline cell,"To start with
-
This is more a post asking about why this weird thing is happening rather than an outright solution, although that would of course also be just as appreciated. Ultimately this is mostly an esthetics issue, and the data set is causing other issues that will need to be addressed in the future. I already have standard filters enabled so I could just filter out the offending row and not touch it, but I'd prefer it not showing up to begin with and learn a better way to deal with it that might be useful in the future.

The formula
-
    =SORT(UNIQUE(UPPER({
    IMPORTRANGE([Range1]);
    IMPORTRANGE([Range2]);
    IMPORTRANGE([Range3]);
    IMPORTRANGE([Range4]);
    IMPORTRANGE([Range5]);
    IMPORTRANGE([Range6]);
    IMPORTRANGE([Range7]);
    IMPORTRANGE([Range8]);
    IMPORTRANGE([Range9]);
    IMPORTRANGE([Range10]);
    IMPORTRANGE([Range11]);
    }),false,false),1,true)    

**SORT** is used to make the default view more easy to glance through (although the entire sheet has standard filters set up).

**UNIQUE** is to ideally combine any duplicates into just one row without manually having to edit the data. What platform(s) each title belongs to is displayed in a matrix to the right.

**UPPER** is to aid in the above as UNIQUE is case sensitive.

**IMPORTRANGE** is used because the data is stored in different files for various reasons. Each range is only ever just one column with just the title name and nothing else.

The issue
-
Having collected games for a long time over I've created a spreadsheet to get an overview of what games I own/have access to. I've been using this formula to list all the titles in the main sheet, but noticed that sometimes duplicates (due to having the same game on different platforms) sometimes gets listed as separate due to UNIQUE being case sensitive.

What I did to try and fix this issue was to insert an UPPER on all the data being loaded in so that these outliers could be handled without editing the original data or manually inserting aliases. This did however cause something weird to happen. Once the UPPER (or LOWER, or PROPER) was applied a seemingly empty cell appeared at the top ([before](https://i.imgur.com/uxmxgMA.png) and [after](https://i.imgur.com/x9ntmS8.png)). Copying the content of the empty cell it's clear that it's a newline character of some sort, although I don't get any hits when searching the sheet for \n with regex search enabled.

I'm scratching my head here trying to figure out why this shows up, and specifically just when the text case is modified. So has anyone run into something like this before? I tried searching for similar issue, but nothing I found seems to match. As I said at the start I'm mostly curious to find out *why* this is happening if anyone has any insights.

What I've tried
-

* Marked all the cells in the ranges that looked empty and pressed Delete just to be sure. No effect.
* Removing and adding ranges, even using only one range at a time, but the newline cell is always there on top.
* Encasing each IMPORTRANGE in UPPERs just resulted in #REF errors.
* Removed the linebreaks I have in the formula (for legibility) in case it was bleeding through somehow, but there was no difference.
* Played around with the options for SORT and UNIQUE, but naturally it just broke the functionality and are back to default values now.",09/02/24 7:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1f74z1o/applying_upper_to_importrange_generates_a_newline/,Bhraal,"This is occurring because you aren't filtering out blank rows in any step of the process. For the purposes of the `UNIQUE()` function, completely blank rows in the referenced range also count as a unique value. The blank row is still being returned in the ""before"" image, it's just at the bottom instead of the top.

You can observe this phenomenon if you remove the `UPPER()` function from your formula and try to type something in the empty row below its return range. This will result in a `#REF!` error because while it looks like just an ordinary empty row like all the other empty rows on the sheet, it's actually the blank row that `UNIQUE()` is returning. For whatever reason applying `UPPER()` and then `SORT()` causes the blank row to be moved to the top instead of the bottom.

The fix would be to eliminate all of the completely blank rows at some point in the process. You could do this via `FILTER()`, via `QUERY()` (which, under specific circumstances, could also collapse the sorting, filtering, and case change into a single operation), or, if you're only returning a single column of information, with `TOCOL()`.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1f74z1o/applying_upper_to_importrange_generates_a_newline/ll57pik/,HolyBonobos,1,,,,,,,

googlesheets,"How do I search a list for if it contains entries that, in another table, contain a 1 in the same row as a specific value in that list?","So that title is confusing. Basically, what I'm trying to do is automate something that doesn't *need* automation, but my autism screams at me regardless. The background might help figure out what's going on, so here:

I have a list of buildings. Some of those buildings provide a discount to other buildings in they are present, such as the Arena discounting the Inn. I have a separate sheet containing a Discount Array, with the buildings providing discounts on the left and the buildings receiving them on the top, with a 1 denoting a discount.

What I want to do is have a cell that looks at the building on its row in the list, finds it in the array, looks down it and finds what buildings give it a discount, then search the original list for any of those buildings and counting how many there are.

For example, in the [main spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/153Ta5SI1QrvtU2bV_q7Q-IOGkjo6o5WtB_SG7DfbrJU/edit?gid=1129504278#gid=1129504278), if cell F38 has ""Bar,"" like it currently does, then the formula (which would be in cell L35) would search row 1 of the Discount Array sheet and find ""Bar"" in column P. Then, it would check down the column and find a 1 in rows 5, 11, 80, and 91. With that, it would check the cells in column A for each row, being A5 A11 A80 and A91, and find the values ""Arena"" ""Black Market"" ""Theater"" and ""Caged Pixie."" For each of those values, it will check the original list of building types, cells F35:F55 on sheet Working to see if it is in the list. In the example, it would find ""Arena"" and ""Black Market."" It will then look at the cell adjacent to it which contains the number of buildings present (IE, cells K35 and K36 which each say 1) and sum all of them together to get the total number of discounts, IE 2.

I know VLOOKUP & HLOOKUP, and some bits of things like BYCOLUMN/BYROW, INDIRECT, the logic operators, and the vague shape of what LAMBDA is, but I can't figure out a way to put together a one-cell-formula that does what I want. I have a sloppy, manually set up doohickey in the top right of the relevant sheets that can make something out of it, but that does not satisfy my autism.

I have it with an example of how the relevant sheet usually looks labeled Current, and one with all but the relevant cells given a uniformly gray background labeled Working. The spreadsheet itself I've adapted off a publicly available one [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wbz-8eFZtD-q0eIY4AtOiEjrQxoNwetMtGmA7RULuus/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

How do I make it work?

Edit:

I've made an example of what I'm imagining using multiple sheets and a much smaller array to present a step-by-step of what the function would do. Making this the primary presentation since there's far less going on than on the original sheet.

Anyway, I've been keeping a spreadsheet of character information for a game I play and, if I can, am trying to avoid making a new rule for nearly 100 different eye colors. I have two sheets, one with quick-glance information, ""Basic Info"", and one with a list of eye colors, ""Eyes"". If the text in a cell from Basic Info's column L matches the text of one of the cells from the Eyes sheet, I want the column L cell to change to match the style of the one its text matches from the Eyes sheet. The cells in the Eyes sheet have different background and text colors based on that eye color's rarity. I attached screenshots of the L column and the Eyes sheet as well.

Hopefully that makes sense lol. Any help is much appreciated, and if you need any more information, please let me know c:

googlesheets,Pros and cons formula on a column: say yes or no in a separate cell based on the higher number of either pros or cons,"Hi

Does anyone know what to do, how to help with this?

Pros and cons formula on a column: say yes or no in a separate cell based on the higher number of either pros or cons

I'm trying to make a spreadsheet for selecting video games to buy and play based on the personal pros and cons I say/write down (can eventually just use numbers on a specific column, if that helps with the final outcome/formula).

It's much like a decision making thing/spreadsheet, but weighted on pros and cons.

Link for help:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DsGLcyyoAiwCaFGPH4NK98oxig2jp-nmSekytr4ZDCg/edit?usp=drivesdk

(we can eventually get rid of the totals, notes and/or numbers, if we manage to get a way of weighting the pros and cons against each other; much like the tipping of a scale)

•••

I want to make a list of games in one main page for overall/glance view. 

And then right next to the main list, I'd create pages for each game I want to review/weight its pros and cons to help me decide if I want to buy and play a specific game.

Then, based on those pros and cons, I'd like to at least have a ""YES"", ""NO"" or ""MAYBE"" in the main/game list page.

That's it.

My second issue is that, while I can get the above formula to work as an =IF formula, I can't transfer it over to conditional formatting.

Click the checkbox (or make any other change in the sheet) to roll a new sequence. The full sequence results displays in the green row. All other stuff that I've added is blue shaded.

You can see all of the intermediate results in the row blocks below the green section. It'll show the random dice roll, the color matching that roll, the chance adjustment percentages, the new adjusted chances, and the new roll ranges for the next lookup.

Here are three screenshots on how to do it. Note: You need to be on a PC or Mac to enable conditional formatting. (Not mobile device).

First, select the range you want to have the affect i.e. A2:A99 (if you go further than A996 it won't work). When range is selected go to format, and select conditional formatting.

On the right side of the screen, click ""+ add another rule"". Check that the range you want is in the top window, under the ""format cells if..."" Drop down menu, select ""custom formula is"" (at the bottom).

If you only want the A range to be conditionally formatted, use the slightly altered formula from /u/HolyBonos :

    =COUNTIF(INDIRECT(""Acceptance!A2:A""),A2)

You want green colour for that code

Click on ""+ Add another rule"" again

    =COUNTIF(INDIRECT(""Rejections!A2:A""),A2)

And red for that one

Press done for it to take effect.

googlesheets,Converting a cell's format into plain text if it contains specific values,"Hi all, I'm looking for help with my gsheets. My problem is that I have a sheet that shows the numeric performance of individual by dates. I have conditional formatting set up for color gradient to effectively see who's performing poorly, based on data from a VLOOKUP function. 

The problem is when it's someone's day off, it returns a 0. I went ahead and added a custom number format: 0;(0);""OFF"" but it's still treated as a numeric cell by gsheets, and thus considered the lowest value by the conditional format I set up earlier.

Is there a way to effectively nullify this problem going forward? Either:  
- Automatically convert a cell into plain text format but keep the custom format a.k.a not returning 0.

OR

-VLOOKUP can return a specific character when it finds a 0 OR no data.

googlesheets,Help using index function in a table to update full row correctly,"This is a hyper specific situation that at this point I'm at a loss on how to Google for the answer, so I'll try and include my whole process before I hit this specific roadblock - hopefully it's an easy fix but I'm open to reshuffling how I do things (a lot of the formulas are slapdash solutions that may have more efficient alternatives, and while I'm open to suggestions on changing them, this is a hobby supplement sheet that I don't want to turn into the Ultra Perfect spreadsheet, I just want it functional)

The endpoint I have hit is as follows:

I have a spreadsheet that is a bunch of lists, and I am making a master list out of said lists. My goal was to have a table that auto updates as people add to their own individual lists, filtering out duplicates etc

My issue is I slapped the master list in using an index query, but when the index function updates on someone adding an item to their personal list, the other values in that row shift, rather than the new entry making a blank row (test term ban shown below) - the values filled in by the index function all shift down one, but the values for the drop-downs stay as they are which causes a mis-alignment of the data

I would like this master sheet to be the one people use to fill out the drop-downs that then get piped back into the personal list sheets (i was just using vlookup in testing this which worked fine) so that when filling out the drop-downs, the users wouldn't need to go to each individual list and need more work to comb through the individual lists

I had hoped that turning the master list into a table would ""link"" the row values together (for lack of a better way to describe it lol) but I found it that's definitely not how that works!

I'm happy to edit in more details if needed, but I wanted to keep the post narrowed in on the issue to save overwhelming anyone with extraneous details (I just don't know which details would be relevant)

googlesheets,Better IF function options...,"Hi everyone!

It's been two weeks now since I try to create a custom function using the apps script of google.

Honestly I've been scared to ask around, because for one, I wanted to try and see if I was able to achieve something. For two, I feel like it's something really obvious that I'm missing and didn't want to ridicule myself lol. But hey! I am here, right now and desperate!

I've tried reading about java script and got totally lost and overwhelmed. Also I felt like learning a totally new language for something, like I said, that seems easy and obvious, didn't seamed to make much sense. It's like reading and learning the dictionary by heart just to use one word. I also tried using AI, and well, I think we all know how this would end...

Anyway, enough of about my mistakes and here is my problem. I just want a different IF formula (a more complexe one in a way). I would like a function that would work like that:

    =Better_IF({Argument1: answer = X, IF Y} , {Argument 2}, {Argument 3}, ...)

The normal IF formula doesn't let X to be a value from other cells it's just a print of X IF Y.

An exemple of the use would be:  
""In the cell K4""

    =Better_IF({=I4 , J4 < J5}, {=I5 , J4 > J5 })

In that exemple the result of K4 would be the result of I4 if J4 < J5 and would be the result of I5 if J4 > J5

I would also like the function to work like IF in addition to the other option, where it can print a result:  
Like ({""Winner"" , J4 < J5}, {""Loser"" , J4 > J5})

I don't know if the syntaxe is wrong, but the idea is that.

In summary, I just want a IF function with more options. And if someone could help me make it or just simply help me find some resources that would help me create it, that would be VERY much appreciated!",08/23/24 15:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1ezmc74/better_if_function_options/,Sunsinsky,"The proper syntax would be `=IFS(E4>E5,D4,E4<E5,D5)`",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1ezmc74/better_if_function_options/ljq1uf9/,HolyBonobos,2,"`=IFS(E4>E5,D4,E4<E5,D5)","`=IFS(E4>E5,D4,E4<E5,D5)",,,,,
googlesheets,"Percentif formula, but it should not only take into account exact matches","Hi there,

I'm a bit of a book nerd and I keep a spreadsheet with all of the books I've read. One of the things I keep track of is the author's nationality: per book, I can use a dropdown menu to select the country.

https://preview.redd.it/cphovrr0xkkd1.png?width=173&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d3beeec89bcac82c90538e521c9409898d5487b

On a different tab, I keep track of some basic statistics. Column C tracks how many books have an author from a certain country (e.g. I've read 35 books by Belgian authors). Column B shows me the percentage of books from that country.

This works fine, except when an author has more than one nationality. For example, I've read a book by Jung Chang, who is both Chinese and British:

googlesheets,Auto Filling Data From Another Sheet,"I need to be able to autofill the names of supervisors on each shift for a given department. We have a lot of supervisors on each shift and its time consuming to look up, I would like to be able to just type in the shift and Department and have it autofill the supervisors name.

I have a separate sheet(Data Sheet) that lists the Shifts, Departments, and the Supervisors. How can I make a formula on my main sheet to be able to autofill the supervisors names from the Data Sheet in the cell needed.

  
Any help would be appreciated. I dont know excel or Google Sheets well enough to ask the proper questions to search for the answer",08/20/24 11:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1ex0i7x/auto_filling_data_from_another_sheet/,DroneTheDruid970,"

|Afternoon|Furniture|Tim|||||

Assuming these entries are in Columns A:C, you could insert Dropdowns on another sheet that provide selections from each, so lets say on E2 you have a dropdown that shows shifts from A2:B and in F2 you have a dropdown that shows the departments from B2:B, and in cell G2 you want the matching supervisor to show up when you select an option from each. It could look like:

  
`=INDEX(C2:C, MATCH(1, ARRAYFORMULA((A2:A = E2) * (B2:B = F2)), 0))`

Where: 

* C2:C is the range of Supervisors names you want to find.
* A2:A is the range of Shifts to select from.
* E2 is the cell with a dropdown selection for those Shifts.
* B2:B is the range of Departments.
* F2 is the cell with a dropdown selection for those Departments.
* G2 can be any cell on any sheet, I just place it next to the other two in my example

*Note, this is a very simple solution and may not work, depending on how your data looks. It also wouldn't work if there are multiple supervisors on the same shits and departments. This simple solution only works if there is a single unique supervisor for each combination of shift and department.

no worries :)  all the data is in the sheet - which is the first CLEAR column to the right? Say all the data in the sheet is in columns A to G.   Select the cell H2 and paste the formula into that cell.

  
Which ever column has the dates in , change the A2 in the above to what has the date value in that row (assuming its in col A as it normally is!)

  
then you should have the date the right way round in that new H2 cell.

  
When that is done and right then copy that H2 formula down all the way down the rows that have the data in

Simply put, people will be submitting a google form multiple times throughout the day with a username and a total word count (e.g. they submit ""100"" at 2:00 but then write more, so at 2:30 they submit ""150""). This form data is collected in the 'wcform' sheet, along with a timestamp. It is range 'wccalc'M:P that I am struggling with. The SUMMARY sheet has a line graph meant to graph a sum of total word counts throughout the hours, using wccalcP3:P26. In 'wccalc,' this is \*almost\* achieved by column P, which filters through all the form data and sums the word counts of all entries submitted within the specified time period:

    =sum(FILTER(
      wcform!C$2:C[word count column],
      wcform!A$2:A[timestamp column]<=O3[end time],
      wcform!A$2:A>=N3[start time]))

However, I would instead like to sum the most recent entry for each username during the specified time period. Column G displays the most recent entry for each username irregardless of timestamp. I'm unsure how to nest filters or sorts or whatever to get this, it's just a step beyond what I can wrap my brain around! I think I can achieve it with like, four extra columns per hour and just filter those lists in progressive steps, but if it's possible to do this without 4\*24 more columns, I'd prefer that!

First of all, your first formula doesn't re-run the NOW() function, because it ends with a blank, which is value\_if\_true in if function if D8 is blank, so even if you refresh the sheet and re-run that formula, it looks like the initial value is still there.

The second formula, on the other hand, executes the NOW() formula when F5 is true (the checkbox is checked), so it fetches the new value again, which of course is the current time at the time of execution.

As u/Reddevil313  said, all formulas are recalculated every time the sheet is refreshed, and the now() function gets the new value.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1ev9hij/if_function_updating_unnecessarily/lith6sl/,Exhelper,1,,,,,,,

Since you have different units it makes it a little bit more difficult to properly use formulas, since the formulas count for example 600 milliliters the same as 600 g (both have a value of 600.) So for example if you input 600 ml soy sauce then this is counted as 600 grams in the total weight. And 6 eggs are counted as 6 grams...

It's possible to get around this if you add two extra columns to the DATA sheet: volume and quantity, and rename the existing quantity column to weight, and then edit the formulas. I don't know how much it matters for you though.

googlesheets,How to create warnings and auto fill cells?,"I am trying to create a couple of warnings and auto fill another cell.  I added a test sheet for context.

What I would like is 
1. If the “Direction” is “Long” and the “Trend” is “Bearish” or if the “Direction” is “Short” and the trend is “Bullish”, I would like a warning to pop up saying, “Counter-Trend Trade. Make sure Clarity is over a 9.” 
2. Then also I would like to fill “Counter-Trend” automatically with a “Yes” if the “Direction” is “Short” and the “Trend” is “Bullish” or the “Direction” is “Long” and the “Trend” is “Bearish”. And if “Direction” is “Long” and the “Trend” is “Bullish” or “Direction” is “Short” and “Trend” is “Bearish” automatically fill “Counter-trend” with “No”. 
3. Lastly, If “Clarity” is a 8 or below and “Counter-Trend” is a “Yes” I would like a warning saying “Clarity isn’t high enough to counter-trend trade.”
",08/16/24 17:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1eu1tfn/how_to_create_warnings_and_auto_fill_cells/,IDoesThis1,"Hi - the first thing to say is that you can only present ""pop-ups"" (alerts) from within Apps Script. You'd have to write an onEdit() function for the cells into which you're adding data to trigger the alert.

I have translated your rules to standard Sheets functions and took the liberty of adding them to your demo sheet (in F2 and G2). You would have to dedicate column(s) to the warnings. Additionally, you could use conditional formatting, which on its own that wouldn't convey the details of the alert in the way your messages do, but it would be a good idea as it would highlight the problem rows.

If I understand things correctly, the important rule is no. 2. Once we have determined whether Counter-Trend is true or false (""Yes"" or ""No""), then the other rules are much simpler to implement, based on the value in column C (Counter-Trend).

Also, the rules are slightly overlapping, as you can see; for example, for Row 12, there are now two warnings:

* ""Counter-Trend Trade. Make sure Clarity is over a 9.""
* ""Clarity isn’t high enough to counter-trend trade.""

The first is made redundant by the second, so perhaps your first warning (rule 1) is not necessary.

And lastly - if you issue a warning when Clarity is 8 or below, the warning for Rule 1 should state that Clarity needs to be ""at least 9"".",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1eu1tfn/how_to_create_warnings_and_auto_fill_cells/likeukr/,gsheets145,1,,,,,,,

Also I have a 4th Column that asks if it's the Best for that Material (Such as cloth, or leather). Same as above, but I want this to only say if it's the best Magic Find for the Material for that Slot. (Eg, the Best Cloth Shoulders, or Leather Chest).

I didn't find anything this specific on youtube, i don't think it's supposed to be too had, but i've lost myself already.  
I've tried conditional formatting but couldn't find anything for this specific task..

The table on left -  i set conditional formatting that says if i make something as ""certain"" or ""not certain"" and etc, it also changes the color of the column at the right side to it (John, Marcus, Ragnar)

Now i want to have a larger tables of more names.  
I want to make alot of names appear in green/yellow/red colors, and i want the table on the right to respond to these colored names, and when i write them there, that their colour will automatically become the color that i set on the left table.

How do i make the table on the right (In the picture), To color me the names automatically based on what's on the left table?

Is there a way that you could write something in a cell in the master sheet that pulls through the data from sheet 2 into a cell in master sheet. .   
If it has data in can you the write in that cell then copies it back to sheet 2 so that when you clear the data in master sheet (by putting a new reference number in)it is saved?
Then when you put the original reference number in it would bring it the new data that that you manually put in.

This is a spreadsheet I created to be able to copy and paste hole info data, and player score data from a tournaments website, format it in a specific way to be able to convert to a .txt file which is used to create graphics for a post production video. I am only concerned with 4 players (or 1 card) at a time, and have all 4 players data sets in the same spreadsheet.

The only data I start with is the hole par, and player score for each hole, starting position and starting score. I was able to create the formulas to calculate running scores for both the round and total (which are the same during round 1 like in the spreadsheet linked).

What I am not sure how to do is to compare the 4 players' scores for each hole, determine their relative place, and output the result for each player for each hole. Ideally with a ""t"" for tied if the scores are the same value.

For example, after hole 18, players 1-4 have values in the ""Total"" column of -13, -11. -9, and -7 respectively. I would like to compare those 4 scores, and output their relative position to the ""Place"" column for hole 18 in each of their data sets. Then of course do that for all 18 holes, but I believe they wouldn't have to be linked, whatever solution could be duplicated 18 times.

googlesheets,"Indirect function causes reference range to be seen as ""Invalid""","I have been trying to work out a formula and have ran into an issue that I can't seem to understand. When I input the range 'L13:L' into the formula I want, it spits out the answer I am looking for, but when I try to use an indirect that puts out the same range, it says that the range 'L13:L' is invalid. This ultimately gives me a reference error that I tried to capture in the screen shots.

Essentially what I want to do is nest multiple formulas within one another. It starts off with a matching function that looks like this:

=MATCH(157,L:L,0)

which equals 8. Then followed up by the next matching function which is where the indirect starts:

=MATCH(157,INDIRECT(""L""&(MATCH(157,L:L,0)+1)&"":L""),0)+MATCH(157,L:L,0)

The above function equals 12, as it should, but the problem arises when I try to go a level deeper with this:

=match(157,INDIRECT(""L""&(MATCH(157,INDIRECT(""L""&(MATCH(157,L:L,0)+1)&"":L""),0)+MATCH(157,L:L,0)+1)&"":L"",0)+MATCH(157,INDIRECT(""L""&(MATCH(157,L:L,0)+1)&"":L""),0)+MATCH(157,L:L,0))

This SHOULD equal 26, but instead gives me this error message **""Function INDIRECT parameter 1 value is 'L13:L'. It is not a valid cell/range reference.""** So I know that my indirect is giving the correct 'L13:L' range that I want it to because the error message tells me it is, but when I simply add 'L13:L' into the indirect, like this:

=match(157,**L13:L**,0)+MATCH(157,INDIRECT(""L""&(MATCH(157,L:L,0)+1)&"":L""),0)+MATCH(157,L:L,0)

IT WORKS and gives me the answer that I want. I don't understand why the formula recognizes the range when I simply input it, but not when it is fed to it via an indirect. I thought the whole point of the indirect was for it to not be any different than an entered range.

Please help a brother out.

It's possible to stay broken (continuous 0s), or broke right at the start of the list. It's possible for the streak to not broken (no 0 at all).

I've tried with couple solutions like:

    =MAX(FILTER(ROW(A:A),TO_TEXT(A:A)=""1""))-MAX(FILTER(ROW(A:A),TO_TEXT(A:A)=""0""))

This will return N/A is the streak isn't broken, have no data or continuous broken streak right at the start. -1 if the streak is broken. More negative number as the streak is continuously broken.

And this one (both credit to u/[Competitive\_Ad\_6239](https://www.reddit.com/user/Competitive_Ad_6239/)):

This doesn't show the broken streak, only the streak when it's not broken. It also showed 1 when the streak is broken right at the start and stack additively if continuous broken even without any streak.

I've worked around first formula here:

    =IF(A1<>0,LET(X,MAX(FILTER(ROW(A:A),A:A=1,A:A<>""""))-IFNA(MAX(FILTER (ROW(A:A),A:A=0,A:A<>"""")),+0),IF(X=-1,0,X)),0)

I'm not new to google sheets and not new to functional programming, but new to the combination of both. I had a small ""problem"" to solve today and managed to do so. But I stumbled in a way I didn't expect and honestly still don't understand.

The Problem

I have a Sheet with several Text entries in 4 columns (A-D) and multiple rows. Not every cell contains text. I want to count in the E-column how many cells contain text in this row so that I can sort the fullest rows to the top.

My solution for E2 ""=sum( map( A2:D2; lambda( c; int( istext( c ) ) ) ) )""

This works beautifully. And is my first time ever using a Lambda outside of Haskell, so I'm a bit proud. Speaking of Haskell and Lambda Calculus, Lambda(x; f(x)) is redundant and the exact same as f(x). So the obvious and more elegant way to write the very same solution would be:

E2 ""=sum( map( A2:D2; int(istext) ) )""

But that falls flat on my face. Why? Adding an empty pair of brackets after istext also doesn't help.

Regarding Semicolons: Yes, I have to use them. Commas don't work. Maybe it's because my google sheets is in german.

googlesheets,Assigning tasks to employees,"I have the following issue: I need to assign some tasks to certain employees - this should be done in google sheets.

The issue is as follows:

Tasks are in a separate sheet - these tasks have due dates, with which I created the conditions of ""Not started"", ""In progress"", and ""Closed"". Based on the conditions of ""Not started"", or ""In progress"", I used the ""filter"" function to bring the data into another sheet, and in a separate column, I created a dropdown to choose which tasks should be done by which employee.

&#x200B;

I realised that the problem with this will be that, while the assigning of tasks is a static, manual process, the tasks part is dynamic. Meaning that when tasks reach their ""Closed"" date, they will disappear from my assigning tab and the assigned employees will remain in the same cells.

1. Use Alignment Index Numbers as [described here](https://support.google.com/docs/thread/95901649/solving-the-dynamic-static-data-alignment-challenge-using-alignment-index-numbers?hl=en). It’s kinda the only way to align dynamic and static data together using formulas alone.

googlesheets,Formula to Reference Data from Other Sheet,"Hi all, 

I'm trying to make a formula that references data from another sheet. I've included a copy of the sheet below. I want to calculate all the points accumulated for people from the ""Schedule"" sheet into the ""Points"" sheet. For example, Sean and Kelsey have 13 points and I want that to appear in their ""Earned"" cell in the ""Points"" sheet. 

There might be a better method, but I'm a novice at this. Currently using this formula =SUMIF(A3:A200,""Kelsey"",L3:L200)+SUMIF(A3:A200,""Sean"",L3:L200) to calculate their 13 points, but I can't seem to get that to apply to their earned cell in the ""Points"" sheet. There are a few things I'll need to calculate from the ""Schedule"" sheet once I figure this out, so would really like to find a way to link the two.

googlesheets,Weird glitch when this script runs,"Apps Script Pasting Glitch

Hi all,

Quick question- I have an Apps Script which capitalizes text when text is entered into certain cells. It works great, except for the odd times when I paste multiple cells of data into a row. I run into a strange sort of glitch where the text all gets turned into the capitalized version of the data that was in the first pasted cell.

  
Example below (first row is example data that needs to be copied, and bottom row is the result after I paste the data).

I tested, and confirmed that this issue only happens when I paste data in rows that capitalize text (rows K and L, here). If I paste the data into row M, the glitch does not happen.

It should be noted that this does occur in all of the sheets where the uppercase script is set up to run.

  
My script is as follows-

    function onEdit3(e) {
      // Get the edited range
      var editedRange = e.range;

But I believe it should be

     var editedValues = editedRange.getValues();

You'll also need to use '.setValues' to update the range with the appropriately modified array.

When you paste multiple values, e.range will contain a 2 dimensional array of values.  Your code currently gets the first value from the array, and modifies that value and then saves that value to the entire range. You'll likely need to loop through the range to determine if the specific columns you want are affected by the paste.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1eqqp13/weird_glitch_when_this_script_runs/lhxg9ir/,simple_riff,2,,,,,,,

tested this my end

Using the layout you have



This will check the value in row 3, for blanks. 

  
starting with the sheet name you want to pull from ""KKOC!""

  
it checks the maximum column number that has a value in it in row 3, then turns it into IC1 in your example, then turns it from IC1 to just IC

  
then the "":"" in the middle, and repeats the formula again

  
This will return

**KKOC!IC:IC**

    =""KKOC!"" &
    SUBSTITUTE(ADDRESS(1, MAX(FILTER(COLUMN(KKOC!3:3), KKOC!3:3 <> """")), 4), ""1"", """") &
    "":"" &
    SUBSTITUTE(ADDRESS(1, MAX(FILTER(COLUMN(KKOC!3:3), KKOC!3:3 <> """")), 4), ""1"", """")



Then all you need to do it wrap that in an =INDIRECT( ) and sheets will treat it as a range and not as a text!

  
So in the DAILY SALES tab you need the following

  
in **A1**

    =ArrayFormula(KKOC!A:B)

(make sure to control, shift & enter)

that will bring cols A and B in straight away

  
then in **C1** you'll need to put in 

    =indirect(""KKOC!""&SUBSTITUTE(ADDRESS(1, MAX(FILTER(COLUMN(KKOC!3:3), KKOC!3:3 <> """")), 4), ""1"", """")&"":""&SUBSTITUTE(ADDRESS(1, MAX(FILTER(COLUMN(KKOC!3:3), KKOC!3:3 <> """")), 4), ""1"", """"))

googlesheets,Show Specific Data Dependent on Dropdown List Selection,"I have two sheets; one (""Source"") is a complete list containing every character in the series organized alphabetically by their last name, and the other (""Groups"") is meant to pull the information associated with specific names depending on if their group name is selected in the dropdown menu on that same sheet. The other info included on Source is the characters' classifications (shortened to class, only 2 options), the names of their groups, and their ranks within that group.

For **Source**, A is *Last Name*, B is *First Name*, C is *Class*, D is *Group*, and E is *Rank*. For **Groups** (the sheet), B is *First Name*, C is *Last Name*, D is *Rank*, E is *Class*, and B6:E6 *is the dropdown*.

Initially, I tried using this as a test:

`=filter(Source!B:B,Source!D:D=""Group Alpha"")`

But I quickly realized that it would only show information for one group all the time with no regard to the dropdown. So I tried this:

`=if(B6:E6=""Group Alpha"",filter(Source!B:B,Source!D:D=""Group Alpha""))`

Which worked fine for the ""First"" column, as it yields a FALSE result whenever the dropdown is switched to a different group; however, it does not yield any results in the other columns even if the dropdown displays the correct selection. I also tried the following:

I can't spot any differences at all that would explain that. I've changed the range data, just to test if it could still be the problem, but even very simple illustrative data (such as the following) made no difference in the output.

googlesheets,How to: Function that can tell whether timevalueA is 'earlier' or 'later' than timevalueB?,"Overall Context:

Trying to create an overtime calculator (that follows my industry protocols), in which I input ‘call time’ (start of work day), ‘lunch in’ & ‘lunch out’ (excluded time), & ‘out time’ (clock out time), and a corresponding grid calculates the split of hours / overtime (1.0x hrs, 2.0x hrs, 3.0 hrs).

A) ‘Production Report Times’ are where times are manually inputted. 

https://preview.redd.it/qmqmgl96izhd1.png?width=1180&format=png&auto=webp&s=35c8b4feea4f61e3905b35d3075a534b5b0b8d30

B) This Grid has a \*mirror\* grid that utilizes an xlookup function to convert time into a decimal (the corresponding data is on a second tab “TIME CHART’.

https://preview.redd.it/vqjd8437izhd1.png?width=1574&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba175fd82575af4607f712df7f06b4c2347b38cc

(Ex. (12:00AM = 00.00, 12:01 AM = 00.0167, 12:15 AM = 00.25, etc)

https://preview.redd.it/swgeahn8izhd1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6a658151cf79d09a3682dabf8a357a7dc443ff9

Realizing a \*slight\* limitation on this calculator, is that if I were in a situation where a worked day was equal to or higher than 16 hrs, the ‘out time’ inputted breaks the functions. 

\*\*\*(See photos above, problem cells highlighted in red or orange)\*\*\*

Google Sheets doesn’t realize that \*on or after 16 hrs\*, the ‘out time’ is a ‘2nd day’ and instead logs that time as chronologically, before the ‘call time’, which breaks the function and showed a negative amount of ""worked hours"".

https://preview.redd.it/l3x058z9izhd1.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=924e83488a20239e851dd01453ce68907f8d0c5e

My thought was to extend the time chart by another 24 hrs of values, and have the corresponding decimal continue upwards from 24:

https://preview.redd.it/xvp4raxaizhd1.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=54fb2779267159b7fa574436f7ea4b36f2099c4a

So that the ‘Production Report Times’ \*Mirror grid could continue adding those times. And the calculator could easily calculate the “worked” hours correctly. 

WHAT I NEED:

Is a function that can go in the ‘out time’ column of the \*mirror grid to ‘Production Report Times’, that knows whether to choose the first time value: 

(Ex. 12:01AM = 00.0167)  OR  (Ex. 2ND DAY: 12:01AM = 00.0167)

And choose based on a criteria (Im not sure what to use honestly)

Maybe:

-> If ‘out time’ is earlier than ‘call time’ (impossible for a working day) then use 2nd day value?

What function could achieve this? Some form of nested =ifs? 

What would the syntax look like to check if a timevalue was earlier or later than a 2nd timevalue?

I know Google Sheets struggles with time values, so I’m not even sure if there’s a way for Sheets to know whether a time (8:00 AM) is earlier than (10:00AM)?

Please advise.

googlesheets,Intraday Gold Time Series,"I'm working on a day trading spreadsheet that tracks the market for gold. It's designed to give hour-by-hour updates of price and volume. To do this, I collect instantaneous quotes from Yahoo!Finance and then break them down into Open, High, Low, Close, Adj. Close, and Volume over the preceding hour as shown in the spreadsheet below. In other words, I'm working with two tables, one containing raw data and the other containing the processed data to be used in making trading decisions.

The system works fine when I manually update it, but in day trading, every second counts, so to save time, I'd like to automate as much of the process as possible. I have two obstacles to doing this:

1. Under the current procedure, I have to change the formulas whenever the value in column A equals ""10:00 AM"" to reflect the beginning of a new business day and then change it again when it doesn't equal ""10:00 AM"". This seems like a simple process to automate, but when I try to use an IF statement that makes time a condition of output, there is no change between 10:00 AM and non-10:00 AM times. (i.e. H2=IF(A2=""10:00 AM"", B2,E3) yields E3 when A2=""10:00 AM""). Is there something wrong with the phrasing or text of the formula?
2. I also need row 21 to automatically assume the exact values of row 20 at the beginning of the previous hour at the beginning of the current hour. For example, if the time has changed from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, I need the values of row 20 to be automatically copied and pasted into row 21 as text only.

The spreadsheet can be edited by anyone with the link, so feel free to tinker with it, and if you are able and feel so inclined, please solve the two problems I've described. Thank you in advance for your help!

googlesheets,Merging rows so there's only one per organization - all other data summed up.,"Hello Google Sheets wise and powerful people!

Every quarter I have a page like this where I have been manually going across and summing up the columns for each organization so I can delete the redundant records and only have one per organization.

I know there has to be a better way :D

I've poked at pivot tables, but it doesn't seem quite right.  If that's the best way to crunch these numbers, I'm keen to learn more.

Any help you can provide is appreciated.

For context, we're a non-profit that refurbishes computers and some other electronics to sell for cheap to teachers/students, non-profits, aboriginal organizations, and government departments who assist low income individuals.  Each column is set up how the Federal government wants this data plugged into their system, but that seems to change each year :D",08/08/24 18:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1enk5cp/merging_rows_so_theres_only_one_per_organization/,canadean84,"I do think pivot tables are part of your solution here, but I also think you are doing a ton of unnecessary manual data entry. 

I added a sheet called OrgMapping. On this sheet, you enter the name of the organization and its details just one time. There were some orgs that were obviously the same but had been input differently so, this will help with that too.

Because, on the main sheet, there's data validation to pull up the name of the org each time you put in a new entry. Just start typing and the mapped orgs pop up. Keeps everything consistent.

What's more, XLOOKUP will pull the matching Receiver Org. Type and	Primary Target Group for the selected organization. You could also easily extend this to municipality and postal code, but there was a lot of variance there so i wasn't sure if it was appropriate. The formulas are pretty simple so you should be able to add columns to the mapping easily.

Anyway there's also a pivot table with the totals for each org. It doesn't have postal code but you could use the same XLOOKUP function to pull the code from the mapping sheet (assuming you add postal code to the mapping). If one org can have multiple postal codes it gets a lot messier.

Hope this helps!

googlesheets,Formula to count how many times teamA plays teamB throughout a schedule,"Looking to streamline a soccer league scheduling process by having my spreadsheet count how many times each team plays each other team. The schedule is broken down week by week horizontally so the data range is broken down into a bunch of 3x5 ranges which look like

{C5:E8; G5:I8; K5:M8; O5:Q8; S5:U8; W5:Y8; AA5:AC8; AE5:AG8; AI5:AK8; AM5:AO8; AQ5:AS8; AU5:AW8; AY5:BA8; BC5:BE8; BG5:BI8; BK5:BM8; BO5:BQ8; BS5:BU8; BW5:BY8; CA5:CC8}  
(edit: fixed range)

What I want the formula to do is check the first column of each range for the value linked ""example: C18"" and then check to see if the 3rd column matches another value linked ""example: E18"" and output how many times that happens throughout the above ranges.

Ideally the same formula would also check for E18 in column 1 with C18 in column 3 as well but I could also split this into 2 equations and then total them if need be.

|50|Pikachu|

|150|Blastoise|

I currently have a sheet that takes a weight entry, for example ""90"" and then references a sheet of every Pokemon, finding the one with the closest weight equal to or more than the entry. In this case, it would be Charmeleon, and wouldn't change to Pikachu until the entry was changed to 50 or below.

My issue is trying to reverse this function so that it works the opposite way, instead finding the nearest Pokemon by weight that is equal to or less than the entry, as well as the two nearest values above and below what's been found.

googlesheets,Is there a way to make responses from my google form follow the formatting in my sheets?,[deleted],08/08/24 20:52,,deleted,"u/bubblepico The cardinal rule is don’t do anything (really: *nothing*) to the sheet with the form responses coming in. When new responses are submitted, they come in on *newly added rows*. This wreaks havoc on the formulas you’ve added to the sheet, and interrupts any formatting you’re trying to maintain. 

Instead: add a new sheet (tab) to the same spreadsheet with your FormResponses1 tab. Title it “MIRROR” or whatever you want that will tell you it mirrors the form data coming in. In A1 of this sheet, put: `={‘Form responses 1’!A1:Z}`     (or whatever your last column of response data is)

Then you can add your existing formatting to this new MIRROR sheet, just like you originally had them in the original form responses sheet, except it’ll work :) You can hide the Form responses sheet from view if needed.

googlesheets,Searching for function advice towards grid cross referencing (see explanation below),"I have a Calender grid that details a crew's working days on a given project. Each row is a different person, and each column after their name is a different date. In each calender call, I can mark one of several different values (denoting which \*type of working day it is). 

On a separate records tab I have a section for denoted crew's dietary restrictions.

  
On a separate tab 'meal ticker' I am working to create a grid that will cross reference the calender tab and the records tab, to give me a clean 'meal ticker' showing how many meals I owe each day split up by dietary restriction.

  
Where I am stumped is what function(s) I should be using to efficiently cross reference (all days that count as 'in person' working days) & (dietary restrictions off the other tab) so that the meal ticker tab works properly.

The original thought I had was to do some combination of =countifs on a second function only tab, and then reference that. But that seemed horrifically inefficient, and would result in 5-10 rows of data for each 'crew member' row. Still wouldn't even be sure how to proceed from there. 

  
In previous iterations of this sheet, my calender tab simply utilized ""True"" or ""False"" for 'working' / 'not working', and then I used =countifs to cross between that and the dietary restriction column. But as I am aiming to be more specific with the \*type of working day, I'm unsure of how to make this work now. 

Addtional Notes:

googlesheets,Need a if formula with 3 conditions,"Hello Everyone,

I am posting this here to ask for help. I am trying to write a formula to determine action needed based on a date. My example would be this.

If I have a product with an expire date of say August 10. I would like the cell beside the expire date to say ""expired"" if the date is less than 2 days before the actual expire date, another condition I would like would be if the product is say 3 to 14 days from expire date, I would like it to say ""Markdown product"" and if it is anytime after 15 days from the expire date in the same month I would like it to say ""monitor"".

Things I have tried is with the if function, Here is an example of what I have got so far, I just do not know exactly how to add the other conditions to the formula.

=ARRAYFORMULA(IF(F11:F="""","""",IF(F11:F<=2,""REMOVE FROM FLOOR"",IFS(F11:F>=3,""MARK DOWN""))))

also tried:

=IF(AND(F11>=MIN(1),F11<=MAX(2),""REMOVE FROM FLOOR"",""MARKDOWN""))

I've got multiple issues. 300 rows

I want a dropdown menu in the Sub-category column that is dependent of the Category column.

I can't put a formula for a dropdown, only a range. I made a sheet with functions that uses the data I want and put this range in the dropdown, but I have difficulties with the functions.

I tried Arrayformula with FILTER, and INDEX/MATCH but they don't work together. I need multiple values so DGET and LOOKUP don't work. Will I need to copy data all the way down? Maybe there's another way to make a dependent dropdown?

Second, even if I can make the ARRAYFORMULA work, when I copy the dropdown menu, it acts like an absolute($$) reference even tho I don't put absolute reference in the range. Will I have to manually enter every dropdown range?

It looks like my formatting is correct, but it looks like the conditional formatting is not following the anchor I set for the columns (Ex. row 7 has no data in column J or K but is highlighted, row 3 is highlighted dark red even though the rule is only supposed to apply to past dates, etc.). I used the [forum help link to show what is happening](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vM_62zGu1CwFo1YOi9HDjxb2ZmCY_1tn6zfXlithcQ0/edit?gid=75140418#gid=75140418) without the personal data.

Here is what I have been attempting and the formulas I have used: 

* Highlight row yellow if date in column J or K is today's date:
   * =AND(OR($J2=TODAY(), $K2=TODAY()), OR($J2<>"""", $K2<>""""))
* Highlight row orange if date in column J or K is tomorrow's date:
   * =AND(OR($J2=TODAY()+1, $K2=TODAY()+1), OR($J2<>"""", $K2<>""""))
* Highlight row green if date in column J or K is within a week of today's date in the future:
   * =AND(OR(AND($J2>=TODAY(), $J2<=TODAY()+7), AND($K2>=TODAY(), $K2<=TODAY()+7)), OR($J2<>"""", $K2<>""""))
* Highlight row light green if date in column K is within two weeks of today's date in the future:
   * =AND($K2>=TODAY(), $K2<=TODAY()+14, $K2<>"""")
* Highlight row dark red if date in column K is in the past:
   * =AND($K2<TODAY(), $K2<>"""")

I am not sure what it could be looking at when applying the conditional formatting. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

googlesheets,"Troubleshooting Complex (LET, IFERROR, FILTER, ROW, LAMBDA, UNIQUE, REDUCE) formula which is not producing desired result. ","I've posted about this formula before and got an answer but have since noticed an issue with the solution formula that was provided. I'll post a link to the previous post I made at the bottom and the example spreadsheet with the previous solution(s) I used.

I've been running into an issue with this formula not populating correctly,

    =LET(_rows, {IFERROR(FILTER(ROW(ProgramOrder!G:G), ProgramOrder!G:G = B2), """"); IFERROR(FILTER(ROW(ProgramOrder!G:G), ProgramOrder!H:H = B2), """")},
      _sub_header, MAP(FILTER(_rows, _rows <> """"), LAMBDA(_r, _r - MOD(_r, 9) + 2)),
      _selected_rows, UNIQUE(SORT(FILTER({_rows; _sub_header}, {_rows; _sub_header} <> """"))),
      REDUCE(
        {"""", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """"}, SEQUENCE(9999, 1, 2, 9),
        LAMBDA(_i, _step,
          IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(_step, _selected_rows, 0)), VSTACK(_i, CHOOSEROWS(ProgramOrder!A:K, FILTER(_selected_rows, _selected_rows>=_step, _selected_rows<_step+9)), {"""", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """"}), _i)
        )
      )
    )

I'm assuming that the population issue is based around the error that Sheets gives of ""REDUCE only takes 3 arguments"", but I'm not even slightly good at complex formulas so I have no idea how to fix it. Right now, it seems to be spitting out some extra rows (both sub\_header rows AND data rows), and NOT populating other rows that it should be. For whatever reason, it seems to populate OK with results that have a smaller total row count, but on one of my sheets, it's even struggling to populate 10 correct rows (sub\_headers included).

ESSENTIALLY: I need the formula to search every 9 rows in columns G and H for the name in B2, If it finds the name in B2 in either column, then it should populate the sub-header of that 9 row section, which is always row 1 of the section, and the entire row (A:K) where the name in B2 is found. For formatting sake, I believe this formula also inserts a blank row between each sub-header row that it populates, I'd like to keep that if possible. And of course, If the name in B2 is not found in any given 9 row set, it doesn't populate anything, or rather, just skips to the next set. I need a similar but different second formula, as described in my other post and as seen in the example spreadsheet.

If anyone has any ideas or solutions, I would really appreciate it. I've been scratching my head and wanting to rip all my hair out trying to fix this beast.

I wish I could share my actual data set with you but it's got sensitive data, and most of the data sheet where this formula would populate from, is also populated by formulas, so it'd be a super pain to edit. Plus my actual data set is around 1800 rows, so it'd be crazy to try and mess with.

***EDIT!!!: Here's a link to the actual spreadsheet with all the sensitive data and names changed/removed. You can see the issue most prominently in ""Kevin Bacon""'s Meeting sheet (and is where I first noticed it) found within the 'LeadersMeetingsSheets'! Sheet, and also can see the additional subheaders added when you scroll all the way to the right of the ""Meeting Sheets"" Sheets, to where the name is instead ""FALSE"". Ignore that it says FALSE as it's a page that won't be used, and is there for any additional participants. Also, please ignore the hidden sheet, as that's just there for the cells that have formulas that reference that sheet, so that I didn't have to find and change those individual cells, and is just used for the total numbers and ID #'s and shouldn't be the cause of any issues. Sorry there's so many sheets and the spreadsheet is obnoxiously large. I tried to remove as many additional sheets as I could, while still providing the information/sheets needed.***

For the line where the target produces a result of 25.42% where the answer is supposed to be 42.18%, I used this formula: =IF(COUNT(H9:P9),(AVERAGE((H9+0.075),(I9+0.075),(J9+0.035),(K9+0.035),(O9-0.075),(P9-0.075),(M9-0.035),(N9-0.035),L9)),0)

For the line (and all rows below it) where the target produces a result of 10.63% where the answer is supposed to be 39.04%, I used this formula: =AVERAGE((H10+0.075),(I10+0.075),(J10+0.035),(K10+0.035),(O10-0.075),(P10-0.075),(M10-0.035),(N10-0.035),L10)

Does anyone have any suggestions?

This throws the error.

=IFS(OR(A1 = ""TOM""), FILTER(TOM!A:I, (TOM!A:A >= A2)\*(TOM!A:A <= A3)), OR( A1 = ""BOB""), FILTER(BOB!A:I, (BOB!A:A >= A2)\*(BOB!A:A <= A3)), OR(A1 = ""TODD""), FILTER(TODD!A:I, (TODD!A:A >= A2)\*(TODD!A:A >= A3)))

  
Without OR() throws the same error.

=IFS(A1 = ""TOM"", FILTER(TOM!A:I, (TOM!A:A >= A2)\*(TOM!A:A <= A3)), A1 = ""BOB"", FILTER(BOB!A:I, (BOB!A:A >= A2)\*(BOB!A:A <= A3)), A1 = ""TODD"", FILTER(TODD!A:I, (TODD!A:A >= A2)\*(TODD!A:A >= A3)))  


Here's the exact error: ""IFS has mismatched range sizes. Expected row count: 1. column count: 1. Actual row count: 9. column count: 9.""

googlesheets,Subtracting something from another number until it reaches 0. Attacking Calculator?,"Subtracting (((Dmg Z1 + DmgZ2)/2)\[Average\] \* X) from (B \* A) Full enemy HP. Then subtracting that first equation or cell from the last cell over and over...  
In my image it is 6,000 - 90, then 5910 - 90 then 5820 - 90... etc... But I'm open to suggestions. As well as still curious if you can keep subtracting the same number until 0.

Variables:  
Group Number: X  
HP: Y  
Dmg: Z

Enemy Group No: A  
HP: B  
Dmg: C

Goal:  
I'm trying to estimate how many waves one can send a group of something to attack a group of something else. First X amount of things attack from A amount. I was thinking to just do the full HP of the enemy and keep subtracting the average Dmg \* X of the group dmg. And keep subtracting the damage until the HP went to 0. After figuring out how many waves it was, I would have figured out how many waves it may take for your party to die... However, all of the enemies could attack the same ally until it is dead (subtracting from A) or they could attack each ally individually keeping the attack the same. Causing two sides of a spectrum.

I don't claim to be at all good in math. But in my mind, this could work?  
I just don't, at the moment, know how to represent this. I was just going to do a formula to find out all the waves and try to see what I can do with that to figure out the rest... Figuring out an easy way to subtract Dmg over and over would at least give me the best case scenario. I'm open to suggestions.

Basically, the player can send a group of various allies with various HP, DMG, SPD (doesn't matter atm), and they attack only six enemies. But the attacks of the enemies are randomized to whichever ally.

Enemy:  
Full HP  / 6, Full DMG / 6 = Each individual Enemy

Ally:  
Kind of whatever they send. I was just going to ask for the group number, lowest and highest attack and hp to get an average then figure out an attacking simulation from there to get an amount of waves it may take. Which could be between the best and worst case scenario explained above. Does all this make sense?

I'm basically trying to make a calculator to assist with attacking a group. I can share the spreadsheet if necessary. It is for a game.

In your example, you have different areas for each month. So we can adjust the category calculation to check what month you are asking for. The formula will get complex because you broke it out by month.

We use the IFS function, which basically says ""If Condition A exists, this cell should be filled with B data, if condition C exists, the cell should be filled with D data."" We will apply this by saying IFS(July is Chosen, Populate this cell with a formula that adds up all the Food expenses in the July area, August is Chosen, Populate this cell with a formula that adds up all the food expenses in the August Area, and so on...) But we won't say ""Food"" we'll say ""the cell to the left"" so that you can auto-fill your formula down.

IFS(Z3=""July"", SUMIFS($C$3:$C$30, $B$3:$B$30, Y4), Z3=""August"", SUMIFS(AUGUST COLUMNS), Z3=""September"", SUMIFS(SEPTEMBER COLUMNS), etc...), and then drag that down to Z7 (which should float the Y4 cell to Y5, Y6, Y7. Everything else should be frozen with $).

Now, whatever you set the month to, those cells will get populated with the SUMIFS formula for that month, the SUMIFS will run, and your totals should pop in. If the month is blank, the cells should be blank. If it throws an error, wrap it in an IFERROR function with a funny message (""No month is selected, silly!!"")

I think that's the best way to do it. If you made it one large column (which might not work for your use case), you might be able to save one nested function.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1eed1vq/help_with_an_expense_tracker/lgat6zn/,Webmaster429,2,,,,,,,

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E9khdBS1VxRKD7yx_Js3y359JJG3vQsRZWm51WW6xT4/edit?usp=sharing

googlesheets,How do you script around checkbox rules?,"I’ve tried everything, but I keep messing up the prior work.

Basically, what I’m trying to accomplish here, are the checkbox rules. If you check urgent and important, the task moves to the DO NOW column. Unchecking the boxes, removes it from the column which is perfect! I also have a check mark that gets added next to the task when the status checkbox is ticked. Once more, removing the checkmark if the status box is unticked.

Here’s where I’m having the issue.

I can’t seem to figure out how to get the tasks to move between the columns based on the legend. 

For example, if only Urgent is ticked, then it should fall under Urgent column, and it shoud remove the task from Do Now if it was previously added there or from the Remove column if none of the checkboxes were ticked. The rule for ‘Remove’ is that every task will automatically fall in that column until one of the boxes is ticked, or added back to Remove, if the box(es) is/are unticked after being added to either ‘Do Now’ or ‘Urgent’ or ‘Important’

I can’t seem to figure it out.

If anyone can help me with this I would be so appreciative.

Somehow, this seems difficult to do. Everything I have found so far doesn't do the job. e.g. VLOOKUP and MATCH are case insensitive, even when the parameters specifying an \*exact\* match are given.

The best candidate solution I've seen was one using REGEXMATCH, however the author of that solution noted that it doesn't work as soon as you try to search for certain special characters, which is exactly what my cells will be containing (any sequence of Unicode characters could be in these cells and I need a literal exact match check). The only form of ""contract"" so to speak is that the cells will all be strings (as far as I know, although given that their values are set with a sheets formula (some of which have the tendency to force cast certain types and there's literally nothing you can do about it) I wouldn't be surprised if that condition also breaks).

googlesheets,Creating a Custom Function that replaces itself with a formula,"I have a bit of a weird usecase, and this may not be doable, or doable elegantly, but I figured I'd try asking for help before giving up.

I've been using Sheets as a workout tracker for a long time. It's simply just so primed for utter and complete customization to specific needs that any workout tracking app just can't compete with.

I tend to use formulas to keep track of the weight on the bar week to week. For example, I'll do `=45*2+25*2+45` that would be two 45lb plates, two 25lb plates, and the 45lb bar weight (or starting resistance for a machine)

This works really well for me because it allows me to visually see the total weight (and use it for any reporting I want to do), and also lets me click on the cell of the previous week to quickly see what I need to load up this week.

What my system doesnt allow me is the reverse, if I know I want 255lb, for example, and I'm also bad at math, I'll have to fiddle with the formula a bunch to make that work. So instead I made this custom function:

    /**
     * Calculates the plates needed for a lift 
     * u/param {number} input The total desired weight of the lift.
     * u/param {number} bar The starting resistance.
     * @return The plates to load on the machine/bar.
     * @customfunction
    */
    function PLATE(input, bar =45) {
      var plateVol = input - bar;
      var result = ""="";
    
      const availablePlates = [45, 35, 25, 10, 5];
    
      availablePlates.forEach((el)=> {
        var plateNum = Math.trunc(plateVol/(el*2));
        for (let i = 0; i < plateNum; i++)
          result += ""[""+ el +""]"";
        plateVol = plateVol - (plateNum * (el*2));
      });
    
      //if any remainder
      if (plateVol == 0) return result;
      result += ""+r"" + plateVol
    
      return result;
    }

So basically, if I do `=PLATE(255)`, the function will spit out `=[45][45][10][5]` (Its cute, it kinda looks like a half of a barbell too, with the specific weighted plates on it).

This works really well, and it also spits out if there's any remainder at all.

However, it's not very elegant to have to run this function *somewhere*, and then take that result into my specific cell and do `=45*4+10*2+5*2+45`. And it's especially annoying at the gym since I'm on my phone and not a computer, so working with the sheet is slower.

What I'd ideally like is to do `=PLATE(255)`, and have it replace itself *with* the actual formula of `=45*4+10*2+5*2+45`, in the cell it's in. I don't mind that the function replaces itself with a formula, because I won't need the function again in that cell once it's run once; frankly, I think it's actually preferable to have the cell be ""set in stone"" once the function runs.

What I'm currently trying to do is using an ""onEdit"" function with a trigger, that looks like this:

    function onEdit(e) {
      var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
      var r  = sheet.getActiveCell();
    
      if (/plate\(.*\)/i.test(r.getValue())){ //use regex to test that the cell is the expected ""formula""
        e.range.setFormula(""test""); //test value to test
      }
    }

And this works *fine* (or it will, once it's done). But this makes it so that I lose the ability to actually use a function in the first place since if I change the regex to require a `=` at the beginning, i.e. `/=plate\(.*\)/i.test(r.getValue())`, this will interfere with the trigger since the actual `PLATE` function will try to run first. And if I don't include the `=`, it's just a bit less elegant since I don't get auto-complete, and cant select other cells as inputs easily, etc. Plus it just feels like a lot of moving parts to have a trigger call a custom function to set a custom formula to a cell, but it's also my first time trying to use triggers, so I'm in uncharted waters there.

and as far as I can tell, from what I've googled, there's no way to get a custom function to actually *set* a cell value (or formula), and thereby able to override itself.

So I'm wondering if anyone here has any ideas, knows of anything that I'm missing, or something that could help.

---

Edit: It looks that by changing the `if (/=fplate\(.*\)/i.test(r.getValue()))` line from the `onEdit` function to `if (/=fplate\(.*\)/i.test(r.getFormula()))`, it seems I can use the custom formula first, then have the trigger replace it. So this should be working for the time being, but I'm still open for any better ideas. 

---

Edit 2: I believe I got it figured out pretty elegantly with the help of u/marcnotmark925 

The trigger still calls the `onEdit` function, which now looks like this:

```
function onEdit(e) {
  cell = e.range;

    var args = /\( *(.*?) *\)/.exec(cell.getFormula())
    cell.setFormula(FPLATE(...args[1].split("","")));
  }
}
```

Basically, the `PLATE` function is now blank, but is recognized as a real custom function:

```
/**
 * Calculates the plates needed for a lift 
 * @param {number} input The total desired weight of the lift.
 * @param {number} bar The starting resistance.
 * @return The plates to load on the machine/bar.
 * @customfunction
*/
function PLATE(input, bar =45) {
  //dummy function
}
```

and I now have an `FPLATE` function which is not set to show up in Sheet's autocomplete, but will spit out the formula I actually want in the cell. 

The `onEdit` function grabs the active cell's formula, splits out its args, and operator spreads them to the `FPLATE` function and sets the result to the cell formula. (I toyed with the idea of using `eval()` since I could just append the ""F"" to the function name...but that still feels a bit icky even though its all my code that's abstracted away and shouldn't see any bad actors)

This is a fine enough solution, so I will mark the post as solved, but if there's an easier way to do all this, I'm all ears.

>this will interfere with the trigger since the actual `PLATE` function will try to run first

Perhaps you should ""neuter"" the actual custom function so that it doesn't actually do anything, it just serves as a placeholder for auto-complete to work.

googlesheets,How to Create Table of Data based on Selection of a cell,"I have a spreadsheet with multiple pages (tabs). The second tab is a detailed listing of daily entries. One day typically has multiple entries. The first tab includes a per-day summary of all entries on each day from the second tab.  So to be clear, one cell on the first tab will include a sum of all entries on the second tab that match a particular date.

But what I want is the ability to tabulate on the first tab (page) only the entries from the second tab that match a date that I select on the first tab.  More specifically, I have a table set up to look like a calendar on the first tab and every day of the month is represented. Each cell in the table shows a total number that is the sum of all entries on the second tab for that particular day.  What I want to happen is that when I select a particular day in the calendar/table, I want something (formula, whatever) to retrieve all the detailed entries from the second tab and display them below the calendar/table on the first tab.

Does anyone have any idea how I can accomplish this?

I can easily return the value if I am only checking a single cell, but no form of regex or lambda or anything else I have tried seems to work here when I thought they've worked in other situations.

  
**Simplified example:** Column A is dynamic and will change, very long. Column C is my static list (roughly around 70 items at the moment). I just want Column B to return the Base Product (C) that is a partial text of the adjacent cell in Column A. If the cell in Column A does not contain any partial text listed within C, I am fine with it returning and error since I will use that to flag me that an update is needed to my list.

googlesheets,Weekly schedule sharing two time zones.,"I’m trying to make a weekly schedule for my office with local and remote staff in two different time zones.

I made two calendars in one google sheet, and I want to share changes. so when I add Hassan to the schedule for a shift from Monday @ 4pm-12am, it automatically adds him to the other schedule (in the other time zone) that is +13 hours. 

I know how to do simple formulas like =B3 but I feel like there is a better way to do this than manually enter 168 cells. 

Here is the link to the Google sheet - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PQaAjwCj2nNfj42fHPNF7EZKctZ4vR8jrP3fDI_-2g/edit",07/29/24 16:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1efb7qe/weekly_schedule_sharing_two_time_zones/,TwerkingPoodle,"I was trying to figure out the edge cases as that often impacts which formulas can be used in a given context. 

One simple way you can improve the cell by cell and instead easily do chunks at a time with array literals. For example, in C43 try: `={B3:B13}` to fill the remainder of that day.

u/TwerkingPoodle I have placed this formula in C43 as an example, and added a couple of test names in the office schedule to demonstrate. You can do similar array literals for blocks of time for the rest of the week.

Here's my scenario: I have similar information in columns B to D. People could enter any fruit they think of, not just the ones currently listed, so I don't have a fruit list to compare it to. I would like to be able to:

**1. Count the number of times each fruit appears in any of the ""Choice"" columns B to D with the list and the count automatically updating when a new fruit is added.** If the data I had were just in columns A and B I would easily do this with a pivot table:

**2. Look up, for each fruit, who wants the fruit.** Again, this is a situation where my brain says ""pivot table"" if I only have two columns:

**3. Count/identify the person for any cells where the fruit includes the letters ""grape"" (should include those rows where ""grapes"" or ""grapefruit"" appear in any column)**

2. How do I specify the cell next to a previously specified cell?

context:

I'm a conlanger, which means that I make constructed languages. I'm trying to make an interactive verb table that conjugates a verb how I want to. In the lexicon sheet (the dictionary), it says next to the verb if it is regular or irregular. So I want to make it check if the verb is regular by finding the verb in the lexicon sheet and looking at the cell to the right of it and if it is then it does a concatenate formula to add a prefix to it, but if it's irregular then it will pull the value from a separate sheet. Additionally, how do I specify the column and row separately but have sheets recognise it as the coordinates of a cell (for example, doing a sum that says that A will be the column and 3+3 will be the row so then it will recognise A6 as the cell)?

googlesheets,How to have a dropdown menu refer to two different ranges (in the right order),"Hi! I'm super new to using functions in google sheets, so the description might reflect my lack of understanding. Sorry about that. I'm just doing a project for myself and a few friends, and I'm mainly using it as an incentive to learn, so I'm open to using addons and formulas and whatever you might have to simplify this as much as possible. I am, however, currently on the level of understanding ""=IF"" and not too much else (yet).

Basically I'm creating a spreadsheet where you can plan your pokémon team based on what game you're playing, all based on dropdown menus. For those familiar with the games, I've already created the named ranges based on what generation game it is, e.g. Gen1 is Sheet1!A1:A151, Gen2 is Sheet1!B1:B100 etc.

From that I'm creating separate tabs for each generation. What I want is for Sheet2 to be one game, Sheet3 is the next etc. In Sheet3 I'd like a dropdown that refers to range A1:A151 AND B1:B100. I tried a few things I found by googling, but the ranges always intertwine; I'd like A151 to be before B1 if that makes any sense.

The goal is to be in Sheet2, and only have access to the range Gen1. In Sheet3 I'd like to be able to choose Gen1 and Gen2 from the same dropdown. In Sheet4 I'd like Gen1, Gen2 and Gen3 etc.

Hopefully this made sense. Like I said I'm completely new at this and in no way a programmer or anything, just relatively tech savvy from growing up with video games and computers.

EDIT: I did try one thing where all dropdowns in a given sheet refered to another dropdown in A1. So in Sheet2!A1 I placed a dropdown to choose which generation I wanted, and any other dropdowns in that sheet would refer to A1 to limit selection. Didn't work and I don't know why (Arrays were involved, but I don't fully understand them yet).

Functions can’t read either one, so switching to background color won’t have an affect if there isn’t a rule to the formatting (as described above)",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1ecfh9i/excluding_certain_color_checkbox_from_google_sheet/lf4mj21/,agirlhasnoname11248,1,,,,,,,

googlesheets,Countdown timer ft. time zones,"Hi,

I'm trying to create a countdown timer that applies worldwide. In cell F9 I have the season's end date, 20-8-2024 20:00:00. This is the formula I use:

=IF( F9-NOW() < 0; ""Season ended."";
               
IF( INT(F9-NOW()) < 1; HOUR(F9-NOW()) & "" hours, "" & MINUTE(F9-NOW()) & "" minutes."";

IF( INT(F9-NOW()) = 1; INT(F9-NOW()) & "" day, "" & HOUR(F9-NOW()) & "" hours, "" & MINUTE(F9-NOW()) & "" minutes."";

IF( INT(F9-NOW()) > 1; INT(F9-NOW()) & "" days, "" & HOUR(F9-NOW()) & "" hours, "" & MINUTE(F9-NOW()) & "" minutes."";

""""))))

That works fine, but only for my time zone. My spreadsheet is used by Europeans, Americans and maybe by others too. One of the instructions is to set the personal copy of the spreadsheet to the user's local time zone, to get the correct timestamps (in a different sheet). But doing that messes it up for this countdown I'm trying to add.

It gets messed up, because the 20:00 value in F9 doesn't change, while the NOW() obviously does. That 20:00 is the time the season ends in my time zone. It ends at the same time for everyone, so for some people in NA that'd be 13:00, while it'd be early next day in Australia.

For my time zone the result currently is ""25 days, 22 hours, 37 minutes."" For an American user it says ""26 days, 5 hours, 37 minutes."" That last one is wrong, because it counts from my set value 20:00, instead of using 13:00.

Any suggestions?

Users choose their time zone from a dropdown in B1. This dropdown is fed by a lookup table in columns L-M which displays different timezones and their corresponding offset from GMT (the time zone I've set the file to). The formula in F9 shows the date/time for August 8 2024 at 20:00 adjusted for the selected time zone. The formula in F10 (the text countdown) doesn't need to do any time zone math because the end date and `NOW()` are in the same time zone. The formulas in B13-B20 are an example of how you can create a timestamp formula that adjusts based on the selected time zone.,https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1ec3j5m/countdown_timer_ft_time_zones/lf2xqg8/,HolyBonobos,2,,,,,,,

googlesheets,Autofill data vertically from a horizontal dataset,"Good afternoon!

I am working on modifying a spreadsheet that will allow me to track the flow of athletes through an endurance event.  I have a set of horizontal time stamps in columns Z through IB (7:00, 7:05, 7:10, etc. up until midnight).  These cells have a formula that will tell me where on the course that athlete was.  For example, if they were swimming at 7:05 that cell would say Swim.  If they were on the Bike at that time it would say Bike.

In another portion of the sheet I have the same time stamps running vertically.  In the cell next to those I am counting to see if the cell in the afore mentioned column equals the word swim and the initial column matches another term (half in this instance).

My count formula is as follows:

=COUNTIFS(Z:Z,""Swim"", $A:$A,""Half"")

Basically it looks up to see if column Z = swim and column A = half then counts it.

The issue I'm running into is that when I try to autofill that formula down it keeps Z:Z and does not progress to AA:AA, AB:AB, etc.  Is there a way to make it do that without having to go through and change each cell individually... it's a lot of cells so hopefully I can avoid it.

googlesheets,Avoid Conditional Formatting in cells that are empty/not empty,"Hi, I'm self-learning how to copy-paste code and formulas for my nefarious purposes, and I made this mockup format to ask questions.

I made a google sheet in order to highlight information I want.

I noticed that when I wrote down the first custom formula

    =$B2=INDIRECT(""ToHighlight!C3"")

it changed all the empty cells to the highlight color (dark magenta) when the cell that affects them ""ToHighlight!C3"" is empty.

1) Why it changes all the empty cells to the highlight color? Is it because I'm not writing it correctly?

So to avoid that I made the conditional ""Cell is empty"" at the top that fixed it. But still I want to know why it changed them & why that doesn't happens with other different formulas.
Also, this doesn't work when I have check box cells.

Same formula for 7 other searches, everything works peachy.

But when I copy-paste the last formula

    =IFERROR(IF(MATCH(""*""&INDIRECT(""ToHighlight!C8"")&""*"",$G2,0)>0,true,),false)

this changes all the not-empty cells in the DataSheet to the highlight color (ligh orange) when the cell that affects them ""ToHighlight!C8"" is empty.

And I noticed I have to put this formula at the bottom, so it doesn't affect the other conditional formatting.

2) Why the formula changes all the non-empty cells to the hightlight color? I copy-pasted the formula from [Conditional format if cell contains partial text match](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/148244/conditional-format-if-cell-contains-partial-match-for-text) and it looks like they didn't have that problem?

So, to avoid that, I made the ""Cell is not empty"" at the bottom but it's a moo point because I have to put it on top of the last conditional formatting to work.... but then that last conditional formatting doesn't work.

In short:

1) Why the conditional formatting formula

    =$B2=INDIRECT(""ToHighlight!C3"")

affects empty cells when the ""ToHighlight!C3"" is empty?

2) Why the conditional formatting formula

    =IFERROR(IF(MATCH(""*""&INDIRECT(""ToHighlight!C8"")&""*"",$G2,0)>0,true,),false)

googlesheets,Help with drop-down interacting with other columns ,"Hi All!

I'm able to use simple formulas (I have a little programming background so not totally green) but am not very far along in my skill set in spreadsheets. I'm here with a clear concept of what I'd like to do but am not even sure if it's possible. Here goes...

I'd like to be able to select a category from a drop-down in one column, enter a value in the next, and then have this value automatically added to a running category total in another place on the page.

So, for example...

|Category (NOTE: these are drop-downs)|Quantity|
|:-|:-|
|Dogs|27|
|Fish|1|
|Cats|3|

And when I select the ""cats"" category for instance, it **adds** the value in the next column to a running category total at the top of the page.

googlesheets,Auto Hide row if checkbox is TRUE (Fantasy Football Draft Tracker),"I'm trying to create a custom fantasy football draft tracker in Google Sheets.

googlesheets,"Bulk buying without overbuying, cheapest combo from a list","I don't think my title accurately conveys my Sheets question because I'm not sure how to get there. But it does summarize my goal.

For each item I must buy, I have a list of prices like so (edited to add picture instead of Reddit table):

https://preview.redd.it/h8m8z95kxbed1.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=61f8417dda7f80f2b83934092d14548d3b5bda83

  


And separately, say, in K10, I have the number of how many of that item I need to order. So let's say the above item is binders, and I need 34. Obviously, none of the existing store links sell them in bundles of 34. I've already calculated that storage of surplus is cost-prohibitive, so I want to buy as many as I need without going over, if at all possible. (Note: I'll prioritize cheaper with minimal surplus over exact numbers.)

I already have a spot that pulls the cheapest per item price and is used in several other calculations. But now it's getting time to buy, and I need to prioritize **cheapest total cost.** I want it to automatically populate something that tells me which combination of links and quantities will give me the cheapest total to buy the number I need. Meaning, I don't just want to buy two of the 24 packs at $2.08 (but for some items that may well be the cheapest way to do it), as that's a total cost of $100, when I could just buy 1x24 @ $2.08 and 4x3 at @ $11.40, saving me $4.40 off my bottom line and only 2 surplus instead of 14. (While that's a small number for this problem, I have 50+ items to buy all like this, so it adds up.)

What are my options here? I have space on my sheets to designate a table if need be, or better yet, I would love to simply add a column F and it puts a number of how many I should buy of that line item (I figure I'm dreaming at this level of simplicity). E.g., to the right of $2.08 it puts 1, and to the right of $3.80 it puts 4.

I'm open to all suggestions at this point. Once pointed in the right direction, I think I can figure it out, but I'm hitting a road block in knowing where to start.

googlesheets,date ranges automatically generated with a random number of cells per day between 55-100 cells per day and misc formula,"General:

I am making a dummy data sheet for a marketing BI dashboard for my company but I'm finding this dummy data to be particularly hard to generate. I have tried chatgpt weighted averages and a few things inbetween but I am mainly struggling with the random amount of cells per day

I have tried having chat gpt spew out the data, but the scope is much to large and it freezes.

Specific:

I need to emulate a company that has 32 facilities each with its own website, each facility averages about 20 visits per week. expanding that out thats about 50-70 visits per day at a company level. currently my best option is typing out 20 thousand entries which is just not going to happen. I want to make a formula that fills in between 55-100 (random) cells for each date in order between 01/01/2023-12/31/2025.

-so cells A1:A65 = 01/01/2023 cells A66:A134 = 01/02/2023 with how many cells each day gets be random but the cells stay in order.

-I can not just have one row for each day and say on this day we had 62 visitors. I need to be able to say at what time each visitor logged on, and what each visitor bought.

If possible but not required:

We  get more visitors on wednesdays/weekends and mondays are particularly slow.  August/January are much busier while april/october are substantially less busy. I would like to find a way to make those days and months be more/less likely to have more cells than the regular months.

Not the main request but would also be nice if you know how to:

1. I want to do the same thing as the previous section except by time of day. Each visit has a time of day that I am randomly generating, but I would like to make 12 and 18 be more likely without affecting the minute generation, those need to remain random.
2. How could i specify a % of the values that are generated. For example I know how to have it randomly generate visit source(facebook, twitter, etc.) but I want to make each one of those source have a rougly specific value or close to it. For example how do I have within the random generation guarantee that approx 25% of my visits will be from instagram, approx 17% from twitter etc.

-I know computer random generation is not great at being exact with its distribution, even chatgpt cant give me exact distribution break downs, but within +/-5% is good enough which is what chatgpt is spewing out.

hoping this is possible because if not I'm gonna spend the next week bleeding my eyes out typing these by hand...",07/24/24 12:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1eb75by/date_ranges_automatically_generated_with_a_random/,miggsd28,"In your sheet, you can use this function, to create a set of row that have a particular date that repeats a random number of times, you can use this Apps Script.

      var random_dates = [];
    
      while (currentDate <= endDate) {
        var randomValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * (100 - 55 + 1)) + 55; // Generates a random value between 55 and 100
        random_dates.push([new Date(currentDate), randomValue]);
        currentDate.setDate(currentDate.getDate() + 1);
      }

        for (var j = 0; j < count; j++) {
          output.push([date]);
        }
      }
    
      sheet.getRange(1, 1, output.length, 1).setValues(output);
    
    }

Now there is the challenge of generating random values that are weighted to some distribution.

It's a bit manual, but here is what I would do for each variable.

In the B column, I would enter `ArrayFormula(RANDBETWEEN(1,100))`

That will gives me a random number for each date value.

On a second sheet, I'm going to create a table with my distribution.

|Source|Weight|
|:-|:-|
|Twitter|10|
|Facebook|60|
|Instagram|90|
|TikTok|100|

Back on the first sheet, I'm going to enter this formula into the C column, and then fill it down for the rest of the rows

`=ifs(B2<Sheet2!$B$3,Sheet2!$A$3,B2<Sheet2!$B$4,Sheet2!$A$4,B2<Sheet2!$B$5,Sheet2!$A$5,B2<=Sheet2!$B$6,Sheet2!$A$6)`

This is going to look at the random value in the B column, and if it's lower than 10, assign it as Twitter. If it's between 10 and less than 60, assign it as Facebook, between 60 and less than 90, Instagram, and everything else should be TikTok.

When I did this on a sample with 2345 rows, I got this distribution.

Basically, in ""Data Dump"" teachers will drop an attendance report once a month (or week, I don't care), and I queried it over into ""Student Information"" ORDER BY Student name and date of attendance report.

I would consider myself a highly experienced user of both Sheets and Excel, having used both extensively for my work in operational planning and data analysis for many years.

I've been using Sheets specifically for my current job for the last 2.5 years, and I have never run into this issue until today - and googling does not seem to yield any results, which makes me think that this issue was newly rolled out to Sheets in a recent update or something. 

Basically, whenever I filter a table (using the ""filter"" module in the ""Data"" tab of the ribbon), the dropdown list of results only displays 200 results at a time. Screenshot:

https://preview.redd.it/bqs3lj5944ed1.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=25d0d2e2d238f0521795dfd8c99737eda0113746

 I have to continually scroll to the bottom, click ""load more"" to keep displaying all of my results. There is no way that I can see to load *all* results with one click - for tables with thousands of rows, this is extremely tedious - having to scroll down and click a button for every 200 rows of data. 

Again, I have never seen this before, and can't find any documentation about it online yet. I am wondering if there is some app or display-level setting that can be toggled to disable this from happening at all, or in absence of that, if there is some way I am missing to load all results with one click, instead of many. 

Appreciate any help or insight anyone may be able to provide on this.

googlesheets,Struggling collecting definitions from dictionary using IMPORTXML,"Hi

I've been working on collecting online dictionary vocabularies by myself using ""IMPORTXML"" function.  
Most of the things are sorted out...  
However, the problem happens when the word doesn't come in one cell but in multiple rows.  
So, I managed to change the formula to

=ArrayFormula(TEXTJOIN("""", 1, (CLEAN(IMPORTXML(hyperlinkedcell,Xpath)))))  
The Xpath I'm using is //\*\[contains(concat( "" "", u/class, "" "" ), concat( "" "", ""def"", "" "" ))\]

and it works fantastically. 

But, it ONLY works with such a word for example, ""iterate"" which has only one meaning but, ironically splited to multiple cells in a row.  
[https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/iterate](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/iterate)

[https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/reserve](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/reserve)  
Giving me good results.

I want to subside the definitions by each column and a word like ""iterate"" can fit in one cell.  
... and did try a few formulas with ""TRANSPOSE"" or using ""CHAR(10) to breaking line but it gives no feedback.

What am I supposed to change in the matter?

On my first separate sheet of \~1k rows, I used ""Sort Range"" to get Column B in alphabetical order and entered all pertinent information. I would like to undo the sort to get the rows back into whatever order they were in originally (and it wasn't alphabetical by another column - I'm unsure how the original sheet is sorted).

Google tells me to ctrl z, but obviously that isn't going to work in this situation. 

  
Also: is there a better way to alphabetize a column so that respective rows stay relative to the information in the column? A better way that's quick to undo? 

Thank you for your help!

googlesheets,How to create multiple rows for multiple names within same form?,"Hi There! 

I am very new to google sheets and google forms so I am sorry if I should ignorant or dumb. Looking for a little guidance. My company has a toy drive that we do every year for different families of lower income that belong to different churches in my area. We are trying to streamline how we are able to sort this information from google sheets. Everything in our current form to sheet works well except for when we have families with multiple children. Right now, the sheet continues down the letter columns (across) for each additional child. Is it possible to code the sheet to create a new line for each new child within a family? Our goal is for the sheet to look like the image below without us having to manually create it. (names and location have been redacted for privacy)

1. add a helper sheet.

googlesheets,Issues w/ Conditional Formatting Based on Multiple Criteria,"Hey all, this'll be a long post so I'll cut to the chase. I'm attempting to observe friend activity based on their recurring schedule each week (time of event doesn't change). To do this, I would have a function that matches their event window to the current time, which would apply conditional formatting based on the information. Despite my best efforts being exhausted after using ChatGPT, the changes are never automated. Here's the structure of my sheet:

* **Column A:** Names
* **Column B:** Day of the Week for Event 1
* **Column C**: Start Time for Meeting 1
* **Column D**: End Time for Meeting 1
* **Column E**: Day of the Week for Meeting 2
* **Column F**: Start Time for Meeting 1
* **Column G**: End Time for Meeting 2

As you can see in the image attachment, the data starts on row 4.

Under the following conditions, here's how I was the cells in Column A (Names) to be colored.

1. **Red**: During the meeting time.
2. **Orange**: On the day of the meeting.
3. **Green**: When it isn’t either meeting time or day.

I've tried using custom formulas for conditional formatting, but I'm not getting the desired results. Here are the formulas I've used:

# For Red (during the meeting time):

    =OR(AND(NOW()>=C4, NOW()<=D4, TEXT(TODAY(), ""dddd"")=B4), AND(NOW()>=F4, NOW()<=G4, TEXT(TODAY(), ""dddd"")=E4))

# For Orange (on the day of the meeting):

    =OR(TEXT(TODAY(), ""dddd"")=B4, TEXT(TODAY(), ""dddd"")=E4)

# For Green (when it isn’t either):

    =AND(NOT(OR(AND(NOW()>=C4, NOW()<=D4, TEXT(TODAY(), ""dddd"")=B4), AND(NOW()>=F4, NOW()<=G4, TEXT(TODAY(), ""dddd"")=E4))), NOT(OR(TEXT(TODAY(), ""dddd"")=B4, TEXT(TODAY(), ""dddd"")=E4)))

# 

If anyone has any different formulas they'd like to try or can see through the sheep's clothing, feedback would be much appreciated. Thanks!

  
*P.S.: Ideally, I'd like the conditional formatting to be AutoFilled downwards as it is likely there will be many names here.*

Add new sales to ""Sales"" by entering a new subsequent sale-id, selecting member ID from a dropdown tied to ""Members"", Item and Price (sheet will calculate sale and daily totals)  
""Monthly Payout"" Pivot table will auto update upon new sales being added to ""Sales"".   
""Monthly Payout"" consists of aforementioned pivot table, LOOKUP to populate Name and Bank Account number columns (Lookup via Member ID in ""Members""),   
calculated sale fee and payable amount.

What I need:   
Cross reference Monthly payout to see if member name exists in ""Work Schedule"", if it does the member's monthly sale fee is to be set to 10%, if not, the monthly sale fee is 20%, calculate their percentage from the sale amount and output ""amount due"".

I have tried various methods, from IF, VLOOKUP, nested IF's etc, but cannot get it to work.

googlesheets,Help with SPLIT() forcing numeric values,"tl;dr: cant split hi + 🯱   with delimiter "" + "" without it making the number 1 instead.

I have a sheet where I want to use the SPLIT() function to split a simple string of the format ""a + b"", (splitting by "" + "", or frankly anything that reduces a character to be on its own) where a and b are Unicode characters. However, if either a or b have a defined numerical value in the Unicode database (example: the \*characters\* with codepoints in range U+1fbf0 - U+1fbf9 have numerical values defined and suffer from this issue), the result becomes numerical regardless of format (e.g. it totally ignores if you forced the output to be plain text, it makes it a number anyway). The annoying part is that the client is totally fooled and thinks that SPLIT() worked fine, except if I then refresh it reveals the true reality of the situation. By that time I've already checked the input off as ""valid"" and sent it down my function pipeline, only to witness as my project is destroyed by the input I just gave it.

I haven't found a way to prevent this, and I don't think that SPLIT() is capable of adding apostrophes to the start of text to ""fix"" the issue (would be more of a band-aid than a fix but if it worked I would have taken it for sure).

AND is already designed to accept an array of values, returning a single value. You can't get AND to return an ARRAY.  To fix this, you need to use BOOLEAN algebra instead.  That's multiplication for AND and addition for OR.  In your case, you would replace the AND portion with

`(YEAR(C5:C)=YEAR(D5:D))*(MONTH(C5:C)=MONTH(D5:D))`

That results in an array of 1s and 0s.

googlesheets,How do I pull data from multiple columns on one tab into a single column on a different tab in the same spreadsheet?,"I've posted here before (username ginar369) about a different issue for the same spreadsheet and received great help. So I've got a new issue and came back.

  
I've got a spreadsheet that I use to keep track of books I've read. The main tab, Reading\_Tab, is books I want to read, are currently reading and ones I've finished. The second tab is the authors by genre. The third tab is the data sets I use on the previous two tabs (book grade, genre listings, where I read it etc...) The list of authors however is so big that I put it on its own tab. There are 26 columns (A-Z) and each author is listed under their first initial. There are over 500+. 

I've used the list on the Authors List Tab to create the data validation (drop down from range) on the first tab (Reading Tab). I've created data validation rules on the first two tabs for the genres with no issues from the third tab (Data\_Validation\_Sets) along with conditional formatting rules. 

What I would like is for the information on the Authors List tab to update to the Authors By Genre tab without using a dropdown validation rule. In the spreadsheet I used before when I reached out for help (I'm making enough changes to it that it seemed easier to start over) when I added names to the author list (they were all in one column) it would update the Author by Genre tab automatically (using something like this in each cell ='Data Set'!B5  ) I tried. I grabbed the whole range A2:Z150. No dice. No matter what I do it doesn't work. I've tried hstack? and vstack? and arrayformulas? choosecols? chooserows?

The reason why I'm trying to make a new sheet is on the original sheet when I added new authors to the data set list I couldn't sort it without it changing the other two tabs. So it made it difficult to see if an author was already on the list. Plus once I got to a certain point (row 620 or so) new names wouldn't show up on the other tabs. I thought that by using separate columns I only have to look through the names that start with that letter instead of 500+.

So I want multiple columns of data from one tab to be updated into a single column on a different tab. I don't know if that is possible.

Thanks.",07/18/24 15:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1e6l1ya/how_do_i_pull_data_from_multiple_columns_on_one/,AdhesivenessOk6261,"The short answer is that you could do this by putting `=TOCOL(Author_List!A2:Z,1,1)` in Author_by_Genre!B2. **However**, since that would entail mixing static and dynamic data on Author_by_Genre, it would actually be much more future-proof and in line with best practices to have this go the other way around—i.e. manually enter authors on Author_by_Genre and have that list automatically populate Author_List. By taking the exact approach you've described, you'll be setting yourself up for a lot of headache with a very common issue that people experience with Sheets, namely trying to keep static (manually-populated) and dynamic (formula-populated) data aligned.

Let's say you do go with that simple `=TOCOL(Author_List!A2:Z,1,1)` approach and fill in everyone's corresponding information in columns A and C-I. Then at some point down the line you add, say, Jules Verne to Author_List. Under your current setup, he would be inserted alphabetically between Judith McNaught and Julia Bryan Thomas. After the insertion, everyone on Author_by_Genre from A N Roquelare to Judith McNaught (i.e. everyone who comes before Jules Verne) would be unaffected. However, at and below the insertion point, everything would be misaligned by one. Jules Verne would end up with Julia Bryan Thomas' information, Julia Bryan Thomas would end up with Julia Jarrett's, and so on down to Zoey Indiana, who would end up in a blank row.

This issue would compound every time you added a new author. Say after adding Jules Verne you added F. Scott Fitzgerald. Now everyone with a name A-E would be unaffected, everyone with a name F-Jud would be misaligned by one, and everyone with a name Jul-Z would be misaligned by *two*. In order to work with this, each time you added an author you would need to not only insert the new value on Author_List, but also insert a new empty row in the appropriate spot on Author_by_Genre to compensate.

What I'd recommend as an alternative that would bypass this issue entirely would be:

1. Transfer your manually-entered list to Author_by_Genre. You can still use `=TOCOL(Author_List!A2:Z,1,1)` to help you do this, just put it in B2, select all of its output, then copy and paste values only (Ctrl+C --> Ctrl+Shift+V). This will convert it from dynamic to static data that will stay in place on its own.  
2. Delete everything in the range A2:Z on Author_List. Keep the headers in row 1.  
3. Put a formula like `=BYCOL(A1:Z1,LAMBDA(l,IFERROR(SORT(FILTER(Author_by_Genre!B2:B,LEFT(Author_by_Genre!B2:B)=l)))))` in A2 of Author_List.

Using the approach described above, any time you added a new author you would just enter their information on Author_by_Genre. The formula in Author_List would automatically update the list to reflect the new addition without any need for you to touch it, and without running the risk of static-dynamic misalignment that you'd otherwise encounter.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1e6l1ya/how_do_i_pull_data_from_multiple_columns_on_one/ldyoq2k/,HolyBonobos,1,"`=TOCOL(Author_List!A2:Z,1,1); =TOCOL(Author_List!A2:Z,1,1); =TOCOL(Author_List!A2:Z,1,1); =BYCOL(A1:Z1,LAMBDA(l,IFERROR(SORT(FILTER(Author_by_Genre!B2:B,LEFT(Author_by_Genre!B2:B)=l)))))","`=TOCOL(Author_List!A2:Z,1,1)","`=TOCOL(Author_List!A2:Z,1,1)","`=TOCOL(Author_List!A2:Z,1,1)","`=BYCOL(A1:Z1,LAMBDA(l,IFERROR(SORT(FILTER(Author_by_Genre!B2:B,LEFT(Author_by_Genre!B2:B)=l)))))",,

googlesheets,Cell Merging causing issues with =unique() and =byrow(lambda()) formulas?,"Hi!

This is not all that serious - I am actually using Google Sheets to track information for a game I'm playing to help with sharpening my skills at using google sheets. Worst case scenario I can revert this sheet back to an earlier version and there won't be any big losses of information.

[This is a duplicate of the sheet that I have removed the extraneous fluff from](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Cj9MuUPGD1t4-7ppzut0YOZdr1N6mZfAzedv2hOnig/edit?usp=sharing). You should be able to see the problems on column H on the tab titled ""Furniture Craftability"".

Essentially I have a sheet that tracks various materials needed in the game to build furniture to keep track of how many items I need to be able to craft those items. I was in the process of adding the sheet titled ""Furniture - Total Materials Needed"" (I don't believe this caused the issue, but it is an edit I made so I thought I'd include it in case it was) and doing some visual cleanup of the ""Furniture Craftability"" tab using merges. However, when I had finished, I noticed that the =unique() formula in column H was displaying oddly, and it seems like the nested byrow and lambda formula that I was using in column I is no longer functioning as expected either.

My questions are: Does anyone have an idea why there would be the ""gap row"" in column H in the unique formula? Additionally, would it be feasible to make the data on this sheet more readable by editing the formula I have in column L1, or would it be advisable to backtrack and scrap that idea in favor of creating a different tab entirely so I can preserve the system I'm using in this sheet before edits?",12/19/24 20:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1hia2uk/cell_merging_causing_issues_with_unique_and/,Whimsicalmuffinman,"The gap cell is because sheets sees merged cells (in formulas) as if the text is in the top left left of the merged area.  Then the rest of the area is considered a blank cell.  So UNIQUE is seeing Masquerade Attire (Deuce) from A2 as your first unique item; then the second unique item is the blank cell in A3; since it's UNIQUE; it only shows up once.

Edit.  Also, your BYROW formula is weird; it's no wonder you are getting so many errors.  You're nested IF is trying to treat the lambda variable (craftable) as a true/false condition but it's really just a range for lambda; so the possible values are just what's in the H columns which is the list of unique items (and not TRUE/FALSE).  Are you maybe missing some other condition statement in there?  It really pops out if you remove the IFERROR around the BYROW which really isn't necessary.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1hia2uk/cell_merging_causing_issues_with_unique_and/m2xf1ys/,adamsmith3567,1,,,,,,,

   * **BYROW(c, LAMBDA(s** = process each of the column ranges (**c**) by row. So for A5:A11, look at A5 first, then A6, then A7, A8, A9, A10, A11. Where **s** = each of the row cells.
      * **TO\_TEXT(s)** converts the value in each of those cells to text if it isn't already.

googlesheets,Populate the cell with the sum only if it contains a value,"**Hello,**

I am new to this. I want to make a monthly expense sheet for my girlfriend. I know there are many templates, but this is how she wants it to work - as long as it works. It has not worked as intended just yet. The majority does, but there is one last problem I need to solve.

There are five columns (A to E) and 50 rows (2 to 51 as Row 1 is for titles only). I included 50 rows with the same dropdown list, although it is unlikely all 50 will be used within any given month.

**Column A**  
This is a date picker. Works OK.

**Column B**  
This is a dropdown list with predefined items. Works OK.

**Column C**  
This is only for user-entered comments. Nothing special. Text only. Works OK.

**Column D**  
This is one of the two important columns. It contains the amount of a single expense. For example, when I select ""Rent"" from the dropdown list in Column B, I manually enter -650 in Column D of the same row. Anyway, what matters is the value.

**Column E**  
The second important column. My goal is for Sheets to populate this column with the sum of the items in Column D. For example, if I have, say, -650 in D2 (for rent) and 300 in D3),  I want E3 to be populated with their sum, which is 1100. I am using the **SUM**(D2:D3/D4/etc) here. It works OK, but there is one problem, see below.

**Problem**  
As there are 50 rows, and items get added one by one as expenses pop up, not every row in Column D is populated initially with a value. Wherever there is a value in Column D, I want Column E to be populated with the sum, but **wherever Column D still does not have a value (because there is no expense added to that row yet), I want Column E to remain blank**. You can see on the screenshot that -576 is entered in Column E in rows where Column D is blank. I don't want the last value in Column E to be added further down, I want Column E to be blank and only be populated with a value if Column D has a value in that row. At the moment Column E populates all 50 rows, even the ones whose Column D is still blank. I tried SUMIF and SUMIFS but could not get the results I wanted. Perhaps a different function is the solution.

Select all your rows including the BOL / SO / SITE NAME etc. header (it won't get colored but we want it included in the range so your formatting range adjusts correctly even if you delete the top row of data). 

Assuming that range starts at A6...

In conditional formatting, set the fill color to magenta and do a custom formula:

=$A6 = $B$2

Always write your custom formulas based on the upper left cell of the selected range, and the range will adjust for the other cells.

In this case, $A6 tells every cell to look in the A column but for the current cells's row.  And $B$2 always looks at B2.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1gc3bv8/highlighting_row_for_duplicate_values/luj1ipk/,mommasaidmommasaid,1,,,,,,,

googlesheets,Data Validation Question - Preventing Duplicate Entries ,"Hello, my company uses a shared Google Sheet with the company for scheduling. Lately there has been an issue where people scheduling are missing names in the ""Scheduled Off"" row or missing that the technician has already been scheduled for another job. This obviously creates scheduling issues. I have been tasked with finding a way to prevent names from being entered into more than one row in a specific column.

I have created a dummy sheet to show & explain the setup: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tVyW55TOOYE4Lsk7qBLktoTIan9EXZJezbFU6UAXG8E/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tVyW55TOOYE4Lsk7qBLktoTIan9EXZJezbFU6UAXG8E/edit?usp=sharing)

Anyone with this link should be able to edit.

I'm not extremely experienced with Google Sheets formulas, so in my Google search, this is the formula I found: =COUNTIF($B:$B, B4)=1

The issue I'm running into is that, in each column, there is a row that lists all available technician names. When testing this formula, the row with all the names were already present. When I added a name to a new row, nothing happens. The row with all the names is giving me an error saying the contents violate the validation rule. However, when I add the name to a second new row, the formula works as expected.

I'm expected to apply a solution to our already-existing Google Sheets, meaning the row with all of the names listed already exists, so I definitely need to be able to work around this. 

Also, due to the setup of our company Google Sheet, I am aware that I would have to apply a separate formula to every single column. It would be a lot, since the entire year is on one sheet... it would be nice to find a shortcut for this if possible, but not required at the moment as solving the formula itself is the priority.

I would really appreciate it if anyone has any insight!

googlesheets,Macro - C&P and then sort,"Hi, 

  
I often need to generate an email list using 2 columns of a spreadsheet.  The selection from those two columns changes regularly depending on why I'm sending the email.  

  
Right now, I have a google sheet where I copy the two columns from the other sheet into my Emails sheet column A.  I stack them so that 2 \~150 row columns become 1 \~300 row column that includes empty cells when a family only has 1 email address.  There are multiple duplicates when a family has multiple children registered.  

Then, right now, I select the whole set of data from column A, copy it, paste it into column B and then sort Z-> A.  This puts the blank cells at the bottom and gives me a list of everything in order.  Then I have a ""=unique(B2:B500)"" formula in C2.  This generates me a list, sorted in reverse alphabetical order, of unique email addresses that I can then copy into Outlook and carry on.  

  
I used to use macros a lifetime ago (probably 20 years) and thought it would be great to just dump in the 2 columns of email addresses into column A and have it C&P and then sort them for me.  (I'm lazy....)

I recorded a macro of me doing the steps above (Select, C&P, Sort Z->A).  When I run it, it selects the correct data, it C&Ps the data, but it does NOT sort it.  This is what it generated when I recorded the macro.  It looks like it should work, but it does not.  Any help?

I'm working on a spreadsheet to work with some aggregated data.  
For context: I have two sets of data which are tracked, both of them with the same units.  
The timeframe is about 16 months now and will grow over time.  
To make things a bit easier, I rounded the time to 15 minute steps.

However, I ran into 2 problems now:

1. Since the time is rounded, I need to find a way to combine the amounts of measurements from within the same 15-minute-frames of the same day. None of the formulas I found so far seem to work.
2. Demo sheet is attached, please see for reference. Since I couldn't get a line-diagram with 2 lines to work with ""table type a"", I tried to find another way. I tried pulling both sets from different tables, as well as combining them into a table where I had a ""category"" column added to distinguish those 2 sets. The second one failed due to the fact that I couldn't find a formula that put them together in a way that was easy to work with. Assuming that the layout of ""table type a"" isn't ideal altogether, I'm now looking for a way to transform it into ""table type b"". Does anyone know if this is possible (without doing it manually), and if so, how?

googlesheets,Is there a formula that can input my highest rated book title each month into a table?,"Alright this might be the most autistic thing I've ever copped to 😅 I have a Google sheets spreadsheet for tracking all my reads in a year. I've got it all automated to update various graphs and tables automatically but there's one I'm having trouble with and I was hoping someone here might know how to help?

I have tables for favourite and least favourite reads of each month. In 2024 I just typed the books in, but I'm trying to figure out how to automate it. On the tracker sheet I've got columns for book title, month I read it in and the rating I gave it. Is there a formula that could work out which book had the highest rating of each month and put the title of it into the cell?

The closest I can figure out how to do it is a MAXIF, but it just gives me the highest rating and I can't figure out how to make it give me the book title 😞

This is the formula I'm currently using:
=MAXIFS(ReadingLog!M:M, ReadingLog!B:B, ""January"")",01/01/25 6:02,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hr1o2d,Kristieboo96,"A bunch of different ways to do it, here's one:

         favorite,  sortn(rateTitle,1,, 1,false),
         favorite)

rateTitle = Two-column array of rating and title, filtered to match thisMonth

favorite = Best rating / title found by sorting rateTitle by the first column in descending order.  Note that only one result is returned in the event of a tie.  If you wanted to sort another column as a tiebreaker, that could be added.

The favorite is then returned in two columns, a rating and a title.

A couple suggestions:

Put your reading list in sheets Table format.  Then you can reference using table references for better readability and easier maintenance:

[https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/tables-in-google-sheets/](https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/tables-in-google-sheets/)

Don't hardcode ""January"", instead use the cell to the left of the formula in your screenshot.  You could also then make my formula do all 12 months in one formula.

googlesheets,How to write code to pop up a message if a cell value date is not in current year?,"Take below screenshot for example, cell A2 and A4 are used as reference by some other formula (such as indirect...) for calculation. Basically, calculating data of current year.

Top 9 rows are frozen. I also keep some blank rows below frozen line (in this example, it is row 10-17), I can manually insert more blank rows if I want. As I insert more rows, A4 value will be automatically updated.

I manually enter new data per below table, for example, the last time I entered new data is 12/26/2024, let us *assume* **it is also last record of year 2024 (no more new data for year 2024)**.

So data is always from newest to oldest.

Goal: On/After 1/1/2025, when I open the workbook, I would like to see a pop up message and remind me to update cell A4 to  **= ROW(A18) - 1**  I use A18 as reference cell because there is data in A18, and I will never delete cell with data; if I use  A4 to  = ROW(A17) , which works too, but I could delete blank row 17 and cause error reference for cell A4

Basically, current A4 value is 29, in function onOpen, the program gets A29 value 2/5/2024 (not in year 2025), then I can go ahead and update A4 formula. If I update A4 correctly, on/after 1/1/2025, A4 value should be 17.

Next time (after updating A4) when I open the workbook, if cell A17 is blank, it is fine, don't pop up message; or I would have entered first 2025 record in row 17, and cell A17 will be a date in 2025, don't pop up message too.

Basically, only pop up message to remind me to update cell A4 annually. I should only expect to see pop up message first time opening the workbook in a new year; after correctly updating cell A4 formulas, I should not see pop up message for remaining of the year.

* Step 1: Get cell A4 value, let us call it lastRowVal
* Step 2: Get value of cell A + lastRowVal , if it is not blank and the date is not in current year, the pop up a message and remind me to update cell A4 formulas.

This uses html templates for the email, which you make by adding a HTML file to your project.

The templateData can be what ever you want it to be. It will be sent as template variable ""data"" to your template and you decide how it looks like.

I'm pretty sure that problems like this is why Excel and other spreadsheet softwares don't have an ISDATE function.

googlesheets,Formula to count the frequency of unique numbers corresponding to another value in another column,"Hi, I'm trying to make a frequency table based on two (or more) conditions. I'm trying to count how many unique values there are in Column A for a varying but specific value in Column B. I'm using countuniqueifs but can't seem to figure out the correct formula.

I've tried to illustrate what I mean in the picture below, it's a small snippet from the large data set I'm working on. I've entered the numbers manually in Column D, but this is what I would like to replace with a formula. So for example, Identification Lv 2 with the number 1440 has 4 unique numbers in Column A. So does 1489 (in column B). Number 764 has three unique numbers and so on. 

I'm trying to find a formula where I can count how many of the unique numbers in column B corresponds to a specific sum of unique numbers in column A (1 unique number, 2, 3 etc.).

Hope someone can help me!

I am working on a sheet for some healthcare data tracking at the moment where essentially I have 14 different categories that are tallied up per shift and entered into the sheet through a google form. 

  
I want to be able to get a summary of the total amount of something per month and year (For instance total number of x-rays in Jan 2025), but be able to change the month and year independently via a drop down box (so I set the month in one box, and the year in another). Ideally once the month/year is set, it will show me all the category totals for that period.

  
A SUMIFS doesn't seem to quite work for what I'm using, but I haven't really used them before, so I could just be doing it wrong. My current formula is:

=SUMIFS('Form responses 1'!E2:E,'Form responses 1'!T2:T,'Form responses 1'!T2:T=Q1,'Form responses 1'!U2:U,'Form responses 1'!U2:U=C2)

***

It's beta time in my video game, and I'm making spreadsheets of some of the increases we've got coming this year. This happens every year, so I'm looking to streamline it as much as I can.

I'd like to be able to paste the log of the AA gains, which looks like:

    [Sun Oct 13 04:48:47 2024] You have improved Focus: Elixir of the Seas 15 at a cost of 120 ability points.
    [Sun Oct 13 04:48:48 2024] You have improved Focus: Elixir of the Seas 16 at a cost of 120 ability points.
    [Sun Oct 13 04:48:50 2024] You have improved Focus: Eradicate the Undead 15 at a cost of 120 ability points.
    [Sun Oct 13 04:48:51 2024] You have improved Focus: Eradicate the Undead 16 at a cost of 120 ability points.
    [Sun Oct 13 04:48:53 2024] You have improved Focus: Fifteenth Emblem 15 at a cost of 120 ability points.
    [Sun Oct 13 04:48:54 2024] You have improved Focus: Fifteenth Emblem 16 at a cost of 120 ability points.
    [Sun Oct 13 04:48:56 2024] You have improved Focus: Glorious Judgment 15 at a cost of 120 ability points.
    [Sun Oct 13 04:48:57 2024] You have improved Focus: Glorious Judgment 16 at a cost of 120 ability points.
    [Sun Oct 13 04:49:00 2024] You have improved Focus: Justice 15 at a cost of 120 ability points.
    [Sun Oct 13 04:49:00 2024] You have improved Focus: Justice 16 at a cost of 120 ability points.
    [Sun Oct 13 04:49:02 2024] You have improved Focus: Spiritual Remedy 15 at a cost of 120 ability points.

Ideally, I would be able to paste that, and it would read the Focus: AA name, and the 120 cost, and slot that into a spreadsheet that I already have built.

Which AA's we get each year changes, so I currently have each of the 6 classes I do broken down into the 4 AA tabs (general, archetype, class, and focus). So currently, I have 24 pages of spreadsheets. I have no problem with running the same script on each page, and having it just match the numbers up and fill in the column.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OJ3UWsRK3DqrX5voGeFn2gEVyzWzk9ACsT4HlLb1InI/edit?usp=sharing

That is the link to the beta doc. I make a copy of it each year, rename it, and start adding data. It ends up looking like this one from last year.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fo0oTnvWQsUhfOZR-UuFtu3xdrR0yWwoUoo23vHicSo/edit?usp=sharing

That's after I've taken all the data from the logs, and entered every stupid number by hand, then removed the AA lines that didn't get an upgrade. 

There are 16 classes. I would desperately love to get this streamlined, so when my arthritis gets worse, I won't cry every year when beta rolls around.

I know it's *possible*, because once upon a time, I had a sheet where I pasted in information like that about items I sold in game in one place, and it would read it, and spit out a tally of the items. Kept a running tally for me. Unfortunately, the data gods seem to have claimed it for a sacrifice, or I'd see if I could figure out a way to make tiny changes and make that one work.

I have no problem with needing to put the information ONLY on the sheet that it goes on, so it doesn't have to sort thru the General, Arch, Class, and Focus tabs, and only needs the name and number. Copying and pasting is fine. It's all the data entry that kills my hands that I'd like to streamline down.

I DO need to make sure that I can clean it up neatly like the second one is at the end, tho if I have to, I'll turn it into a neat little png that folks can look at rather than copy and interact with. It's usually set up in the neat version so that my guildmates can make their own copy to mark up however they want, without messing with mine. But if a neat picture is all they get from now on, and I save my hands and my time in the process, I'm all in.

googlesheets,Formula Questions Using Dates ,"Hi all, I have two questions regarding formulas that use dates (for scheduling purposes). My ""Master Tab"" is the ""template"" tab. I adjust the dates every week when I do schedules and input the shifts on this tab. I am trying to get my ""Hours breakdown"" tab to auto populate sales from the ""blackbook"" tab based on the date. 



As you can see in the hours breakdown tab, I am using a map function in row 3 to pull the data from the blackbook tab. However the function is not reading the data in blackbook as a date, it is reading it as a 5digit number that I don't understand. Is there a way I can adjust this so that it pulls the data properly?



I also want to set this function up so that it pulls data based on the day of the week not the specific date (I.e.... for Monday 1/6/25 I want to pull the sales data from Monday 1/8/24, Tuesday 1/7/25 I want to pull the sales data from Tuesday 1/9/24 ... and so on.) Is this a simple formula as well. I am trying to automate everything as much as possible so that all I have to do is adjust the date range on the ""template"" sheet and all the sales auto populate in row 3 on the hours breakdown so it is less manual entry for me.

by the way, if you just want to match the date on Blackbook column B with Hours Breakdown B2 and get the value of Blackbook Column E, you may simple use XLOOKUP formula...

here any time a cell editted this function will triggered.. so, we get the range of the edited cell, and record the old value comes from the event object, than record to new value comes from cell.. check if its on column 3, which is you wanted to change.. and if the old and new value is not the same, assign new date to the one column before on the same row.

I now am looking to find a way for when the names get generated on the rankings sheet it will have the corresponding background color on their name in the second sheet that corresponds to the background color of that name's grade on the first sheet.

googlesheets,I can't get conditional formatting to work based on other cells.,"I'm trying to create a sheet to keep up with a game's material grinding. The materials are separated into bronze, silver or gold grade and I thought it would be good to get the grades shown via conditional formatting.

[Screenshot of the sheet](https://preview.redd.it/ixp8b9acav9e1.png?width=1883&format=png&auto=webp&s=08fbabf6537e5d2902c7f2656e4a839ec1a40d99)

On the left is the list of all the materials, the grades and which enemy they come from. On the right is the part that I'm racking my head over. It's a breakdown of all the materials a character needs (the character is in parentheses with the green formatting for ease of finding them).

I'd like to match the material in column J with the material in columns B, C and D respectively in conditional formatting. As an example let's use bronze, I'd want to conditionally format column G with a rule that all the items in it that match column B (bronze materials) would be formatted.

Your bronze conditional format rule should be:
* apply to range: `G1:G` *(or, if you want it to apply to multiple columns, it would be: `G1:J`)*
* from the dropdown: `custom formula`
* in the formula field: `=COUNTIF($B:$B,$G1)>0`

In the case of a color scale, it applies to the entire range even if some cells are left unfilled by a color. This means that lower rules for that same range won’t get activated at all, since every cell in that range already has a conditional format rule applied to it.

A workaround would be combining them into a single color scale rule where you set the “midpoint” at 0 with the color yellow, the green as the max point and the red as the min point. An alternative would be using multiple conditional format rules (not color scales!) with one for each color.

googlesheets,LOOKUP Multiple using IF formula?,"Hi! I've been trying to solve this all day. I'm trying to create an itinerary in googlesheets using meeting availability data collected in another sheet. On sheet A, I've created dropdown cells for professors to indicate their availability to meet with a guest speaker. I will then manually go through the data and specify times for each professor to meet with the speaker by changing the dropdown to ""Set (Admin Only)"". Most meetings are one-on-one. The formula gets more difficult when it is time to set groups for lunch and dinner meetings. These will include up to three professors at a time.

On sheet B, I have created the preliminary outline for automatically filling the data from sheet A into the itinerary template. I have also attached an image of a sample itinerary - this is the goal!

I would like to be able to have each meeting time LOOKUP the professor's name and phone number, or name and office location IF the dropdown is set to ""Set (Admin Only)"". I would like for this data to CONCATENATE into one cell.

I tried INDEX-MATCH, ARRAY, FILTER and LOOKUP, but I can't seem to concoct the correct collection of formulas to make this work. Perhaps this is too tall an order?

I would be incredibly grateful for any suggestions you can offer as we have a dozen speakers coming to visit over the next month and manually preparing these itineraries is tedious and time consuming. Thank you so much!

googlesheets,How to use if statement on a query to know if there is an error or just an empty output.,"I am trying to create a search function for work. However, the people I work with are not technologically inclined so I am trying to make it as easy as possible for them to use and troubleshoot. Sometimes there will be no matches to the query or there might be an error, so I want to find a way to isolate different errors to let them know if it is just a 0 match or if there is an actual error. 

  
I tried an if statement with an isblank or a query = """" however I found out online that when a query has no result it outputs an empty string or something and  those methods do not work.

Make the text Red using this rule, and you shouldn't need any other rule.

googlesheets,Dynamically AVG specific cell across existing & future sheets created,"I've created and have manually managed a budget tracker month over month, for the past year. This tracker spits out a lot of data like MoM avgs, YtD avgs, etc. At the end of each month, I create a new tab for the upcoming month and have a fixed naming convention for each tab (ie Jan24\_CC, Feb24\_CC, etc.) Up to this point, I've been manually adding the new month to the AVG formulas, which is monotonous and not super reliable, as sometimes I'll forget to update cells, which skews AVGs after a couple months if it goes unnoticed.

I'm creating a dashboard to show progression YoY and was curious, Is there any formula I can use that can dynamically listen/pull in values from past, present and future sheets I create, assuming the data remains fixed to a specific cell? Or maybe it doesn't necessarily need to stay fixed, perhaps using some form of QUERY?

I've created a dedicated sheet that uses INDIRECT to coalesce all the values, then do an AVG formula using that range of INDIRECT data. It works for most part, but still requires me manually updating the formulas at the end of each month.

I'm all ears and open for suggestions. Here's a example sheet to hopefully help contextualize what I'm working with.

Delete your results table data and place this into cell B10.

I'm not sure I can comment on the best statistical test without knowing what the data is.  This formula though would easily be able to be swapped MEDIAN for AVERAGE though or any other statistical test as it's inputting an array of the correct numbers to the test function.

googlesheets,Is there a way to change percentage to dividened and divisor (if that is what it is called?),"To start off: I've never studied maths in English so I don't know if dividend and divisor are the correct terms, but what I mean is that 50%=1/2.

Basically, I'm trying to create a simple spreadsheet to calculate how many factories are needed to be divided in relation to infantry equipment in the videogame Hearts of Iron IV (see screenshot below).

In coloumn H, I have compared the value in column G with data points gathered by testing how much equipment is manufactured in military factories over the span of one year, and since different pieces of equipment cost different amount of industrial points, different amounts of output is found for these different pieces.

So, if I have done it correctly (which I might not have), for every military factory on infantry equipment, I want 63%, which is roughly 2/3rds, to be put on artillery, and so on. 

Is there any way to convert 63% into dividened and divisor graphically in the I-column, perferably rounding off to the closest 1-digit so I don't end up with XY/ABC or something like that. It would be much easier at a glance to figure out how many factories are needed if I get it as a divided, so I can see that ""roughly speaking, for every 10 factories on military equipment, I will need 6/10 on artillery, 3/10 on support equipment"" and so on. 

Come to think of it, I probably need to change it to not be in relation to infantry equipment, since the total sum of military production points on infantry equipment is less than half of the total military production put into a division. But that's a problem for a different day. 

**Right now, I just want to convert the 63% in column H into ≈ 2/3 graphically in column I.**

googlesheets,Weighted average - skipping some cells?,"Hello! This is my first time really using functions in Google Sheets and I am overwhelmed and confused. I am trying to make a function that will give a score for my game reviews - it does a weighted average of the followings categories with these weights: Story (2.5), Combat (3), Gameplay (2.5), Music (1), Art (1)

I have used this type of function: =AVERAGE.WEIGHTED(F28,2.5,G28,3,H28,2.5,I28,1,J28,1)

But the problem if a game doesn't have combat, I can't score it in that category. I have been filling in those cells with ""--"" to show I can't score it and then manually changing the function to something like  =AVERAGE.WEIGHTED(F27,2.5,H27,2.5,I27,1,J27,1) but then if a game doesn't really have a story, I have to manually change it again.

Is there a way to fix this so it gives my weighted score but omits cells with ""--"" or that are left blank? I'd like to have a function that works for everything if possible.

I have Googled this but it is so confusing to me and I have no idea how to apply the things I'm reading to my actual Sheets lol. Thank you for your help if you're reading this!

* **Apps Script:** I've also tried writing an Apps Script, but I'm not very experienced with scripting and I'm struggling to get it to work correctly.

I am attempting to create one year of student assignments that rotates equally among students and also leaves room to remove and add names as students move in or out.

I help organize assignments for 2 different groups of students - one younger and one older group. Each Friday morning 3 students from group 1 are assigned the following tasks:

1. Welcome class
2. Recite school motto
3. Give brief presentation on any topic we studied that week that they found interesting

Each Friday afternoon 3 students from group 2 are assigned the same tasks but in slightly order:

1. Recite school motto
2. Give brief presentation on any topic we studied that week that they found interesting
3. Farewell/Release students to go home

In each group we have between 20-30 students. I am attempting to create 50 weeks of assignments using a list of names from each group that would evenly distribute assignments among student to each topic that year.

I also need the formula to allow me to remove a student if they move away and redistribute the names among the assignments and remaining students from that time forward. Additionally, I need the formula to allow me to add a new student and redistribute the assignments going forward if a new student moves in. 

Basically the initial questions I need answered are what is this type of document called and what formulas do I need to create this document? I don’t know the appropriate terminology to enable me to find tutorials.

But i came up with a formula that distributes tasks to a group.

It takes one group and one task list and distributes it as often as you want.

It assumes that the group list is in column A ( A2:A). The task list is in column E (E2:E) and the number of rotations (weeks) is in I1.

It then just randomizes the group list and then rotates it through the tasks, I1 times. It tries to avoid duplications and i think i managed that as much as possible - but i'm not guaranteeing it :)

You can add kids or remove them as well as changing the task list and the formula will distribute it. But it **does not** take prior assignments into account - i didn't figure that one out - yet at least ...

I decided to post this like this anyway, in case you might want to build upon it (or someone). Also you can just run it separately on each group to get distribution for group 1 and 2 :)

googlesheets,Need to create weekly rotating assignments for one year for students while accounting for students moving in/out,"Edit: Thank you both for your help! I didn't expect this much from anyone, just search terms. I'm so so so grateful! You rock! Thank you!!!!!!

I am attempting to create one year of student assignments that rotates equally among students and also leaves room to remove and add names as students move in or out.

I help organize assignments for 2 different groups of students - one younger and one older group. Each Friday morning 3 students from group 1 are assigned the following tasks:

1. Welcome class
2. Recite school motto
3. Give brief presentation on any topic we studied that week that they found interesting

Each Friday afternoon 3 students from group 2 are assigned the same tasks but in slightly order:

1. Recite school motto
2. Give brief presentation on any topic we studied that week that they found interesting
3. Farewell/Release students to go home

In each group we have between 20-30 students. I am attempting to create 50 weeks of assignments using a list of names from each group that would evenly distribute assignments among student to each topic that year.

I also need the formula to allow me to remove a student if they move away and redistribute the names among the assignments and remaining students from that time forward. Additionally, I need the formula to allow me to add a new student and redistribute the assignments going forward if a new student moves in. 

Basically the initial questions I need answered are what is this type of document called and what formulas do I need to create this document? I don’t know the appropriate terminology to enable me to find tutorials. My attempts thus far have been results for work/class schedules or chore charts but none of them have helped me create the document I describe.

The sheet has instructions on how to use it. You can Make a Copy of it from the File Menu. Formulas are highlighted in yellow.

Some key points:

* Make sure the Start Week & End Week Dates are correct.
* For the Initial List of Students in Each Group, assign their Start Date to the Start Week Date (week 1), and their End Date to the End Week Date (last week #).
* To remove a student, change their End Date to their last Friday date available.
* To add a student, add their name to the bottom of a group list and assign their Start Date to their first available Friday, and their End Date to the End Week Date (last week #). New students are placed in the beginning of the roster to ensure they get a turn at a role.

\[Edit\] u/[DawnDevonshire](https://www.reddit.com/user/DawnDevonshire/) Final tweaks were made to the sheet to ensure everyone gets to handle each row. You can add and ""remove"" students as needed. Just follow the instructions.

It should be such a simple task but I've spent a full day on this and I *cannot* figure this out.

So my for each new entry (new book), I record the author of the book (Column AI2:AI), and the date I started the book (Column BE2:BE). Of course I log more information but this seems to be the most relevant. I'm trying to use formulas to track how many new authors I've read this year. The issue I'm running into is separating new authors from repeat authors when creating the list to use my COUNT function on.

For example I read from J.R.R. Tolkien in 2023, and 2024. So any time I create a list of entries from the current year, or previous years, he appears in both. I'm no expert in formulas so I'm using AI to build them, and I've had great luck with that but I can't seem to get it to create a list of authors whom I read from in the current year, but exclude them if I also read from them in previous years.

I suspect it has something to do with the formulas creating UNIQUE lists out of the author column before filtering them out through the individual entries, so I've gone through several different approaches, but I could be completely missing the mark. I could also be WAY overcomplicating this. Either way I don't know how to fix it, and no amount of re--prompting will get Copilot to fix it either.

googlesheets,"Any way to increase the ""index"" in an import HTML function?","Can't change the title but I meant IMPORTXML not HTML  
  
Hello there, I was wondering if there was any way to do this:

Currently I'm importing some data from a website using:  
=INDEX(IMPORTXML(""https://www.URL.com"",""//\*\[@class='class-i'm-pulling'\]""),1)

I was wondering if there was any way to increase the value of the ""1"" in that formula each time the formula is used.

This will create a sequence of numbers then map each number in turn into your function where the X is; it's currently going to read out as a column; but if you move the 100 to the second position so like SEQUENCE(1,100,1,1) it will read out as a row instead.  

Assuming i understood your ask; this will be the equivalent of putting your formula with the different numbers in a column of 100 cells tall; it's not the same as iterating through the numbers in the same cell.  Hopefully that's what you meant.

Within sequence you can easily change the start number, increment, and total numbers it will output.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1hll3uq/any_way_to_increase_the_index_in_an_import_html/m3nvjsx/,adamsmith3567,1,"`=MAP(sequence(100,1,1,1),lambda(x,INDEX(IMPORTXML(""https://www.URL.com"",""//*[@class='class-i'm-pulling']""),x)))","`=MAP(sequence(100,1,1,1),lambda(x,INDEX(IMPORTXML(""https://www.URL.com"",""//*[@class='class-i'm-pulling']""),x)))",,,,,

I have lots of paints stored in a database which included a ""preview"" of the color in RGB values.  
When i export it to a csv for usage it will export the preview in RGB value.  
For example a preview of a color will show this inside a cell: 82;57;45

But i would like to view that value as a backgroundcolor of the cell.  
Is that even possible in googlesheets to convert it and usa as backgroundcolor?",10/13/24 6:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1g2nn3a/possible_to_auto_fill_background_color_based_on/,user11az,">var rgb = '152,146,136'; // IN HEX = #989288

>range.setBackgroundRGB(rgb); //NOT WORKING

This does not work because rgb is defined as a text string. setBackgroundRGB expects three integer values (numbers).

You will have to split the text string apart and extract each number so that you end up with something like:

    var rgb = '152,145,136'
    var rgbSplit = rgb.split(',')
    var r = Number(rgbSplit[0])
    var g = Number(rgbSplit[1])
    var b = Number(rgbSplit[2])

googlesheets,Conditional Formatting Duplicates within Ranges,"I need help with a formula. Everything I've found online is focused on searching rows or columns, not ranges. 

My goal is to have names highlighted in the ""POSITIONAL INVENTORY"" section (B9:F34) when I type a player name into the ""OUT"" section (B3:L5). How can I tweak the ""countif"" formula to achieve this?",12/22/24 17:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1hkajac/conditional_formatting_duplicates_within_ranges/,ryanmgalasso,"For reference:

    =if(isblank(B9), false, countif(B$3:$L$5, B9))

Which now that I wrote it kind of sucks cause you're writing B9 twice, and one of them is kind of hidden.

You could get fancier with let() which also helps self-document your code, and I recommend in general for other stuff, but is starting to be overkill here:

    =let(player,B9, out,B$3:$L$5, if(isblank(player),false,countif(out,player)))

Except that in testing on your sheet, neither works because your lookup formula is not outputting true blanks, but empty strings """"

    =IF('MASTER ROSTER'!G3=0,"""",'MASTER ROSTER'!G3)

To output a true blank (empty cell) you would instead use an empty argument:

    =IF('MASTER ROSTER'!G3=0, , 'MASTER ROSTER'!G3)

  
You're also comparing the master name to to =0 which which is unusual, unless sometimes it's actually a zero? Otherwise you could skip the whole comparison:

    ='MASTER ROSTER'!G3

Or.. just do the whole thing including titles all at once. I put this in your OUT tab B8.  You have to delete all the existing values so this can expand.

    =arrayformula('MASTER ROSTER'!G2:K28)

This technique wouldn't work if you want to be able to manually override individual player names.

I've been trying, but can't find a solution to my problem with google sheets. I'm not very good at it, so maybe it's an easy job, but I am not able to see it.

So I'm trying to make an autogenerated weekly schedule (just for a visual representation of the appointments) based on the info I put on a table in another sheet. In that table there's a column with the date, another with the hour, and another with the name of the client. So based on that (date and hour), I would like to have a kind of hour calendar where I can see the appointments clearer. I would be happy if the cell that matches date&hour changed color for instance. It would be awesome if it returned the name of the client that has the appointment at that date and hour, but it's not really necessary. Anyway, I don't know how to make any of it happen T\_T

googlesheets,Grouping and Sorting based on different columns/labels ,"I've been working on a spreadsheet of my books for a hot minute now--this is version two, and I'm doing my best to get it as organized as I can to avoid it being a mess again down the road (as my last one was). I've gotten the books all input with columns labeled as isbn/Authorlast/first/title/series/# in series/and a few other distinctions for myself. This spreadsheet is both to compile data (bc I'm interested), keep track of my collection, and help me prep for reorganizing my shelves.

I would prefer to have them in alphabetical order based on author last names, which I have figured out easily, but I also really like the look of it grouping by series with the distinct group breaks as it makes it super clear, but my hopes of sorting by author's last and *then* having the grouping seems to not be an option. Any recommendations for how I can keep the style of a series header for visual distinction without having to do the metaphorical footwork of it myself? My last spreadsheet was that tedious footwork, and it went horribly, as it became a struggle to add in new purchases. My goal here is to be able to just add them to the end as I buy, and the sheet can file it in place (more or less).

The ""logical"" grouping in your case, would be a grouping of author, title. You can accomplish that by making a formulated cell in your table: `=Author & ""/"" & Title` (replace by cell, or table column, references that fit your scenario). Then you can group the data on that field. That will get you *almost* what you want, except the grouping header will read ""Author/Title"" instead of just ""Title"". You can then hide the column if you don't want it visible in your table.

I think that's as close as you can get this though.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1hk7x9l/grouping_and_sorting_based_on_different/m3g2lw4/,One_Organization_810,2,,,,,,,
googlesheets,2 lists of football teams pulled from 2 different sources so the names are slightly different. Sometimes list 1 has extra letters sometimes list 2 has extra letters.,"So I have 2 lists of football teams. Call them list 1 in column D and list 2 in column F.

These lists are pulled from external sites using importhtml. However, the names of the teams are slightly different. For example, list 1 may call the team Barcelona but list 2 calls them FC Barcelona. I got around this by using xlookup(“ *”&D5&” *”,F5:F54, c5:c54, “not found”,2)

googlesheets,Having trouble duplicating CF,"Hello friends.

I have a simple spreadsheet tracking bodyweight and measurements. I want to use CF to highlight a cell green if the number is greater than the cell directly above it, and red if it is less than.

I.e. Cell G3 will highlight green if the value is greater than =G2.

It works for that cell.

I want to copy this rule across so that cell H3 will highlight green if greater than =H2. 

The problem is if I try to copy and paste the cell's conditional formatting across a column, or use the paint format function, it MODIFIES the original CF rule in G3 to be a range (G3:H3 highlights green if greater than =G2).

I don't want this. I want it to act the way normal data would when being copied across columns and transpose the original data to the new columns (H3 highlights if greater than =H2).

This may not be possible but surely I don't have to endure the monotony of creating two seperate rules for every single cell (There are hundreds) Just to get this app to do what I want.

If you had a whole ton of simple ranges (that you don't have extra processing like the first range), you could create an array of them at the top and step through that, calling fixSheetDecimals() for each of them.

But... you're already adding quite a bit of maintenance just with these ranges.   So if you have a bunch, I'd do something different.  Like perhaps make your special cells a different color and search for that color in your code so your script doesn't have to know anything other than the special color.

Or if you want **every** $ format to follow this formatting, then you could instead:

Format new cells as some sort of ""$#,000"" format.  Search your entire sheet looking for those formats, and update them as needed.

If that wouldn't work for the whole sheet, perhaps you could at least do it to solve this issue:

>By the way, I cannot use B2:M & endRow , let us say, I have a percentage number in cell M10, and I don't want to mess up its percentage format.

Use B2:M as your range.  Clip it to getLastRow() which is the last row containing any data.  In your function, first check if the existing sheet format starts with ""$"" and if not then leave it alone.

That would be much more reliable than checking a special cell with the number of rows. And worst-case, all you do is mess up some $ formatting, not something else.",https://reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1hjz61h/how_to_get_combined_data_range_and_for_each_cell/m3djyyr/,mommasaidmommasaid,1,,,,,,,

googlesheets,Apps Script to automatically add/delete rows based on a cell value,"Hi,

I'm new to Apps Script and tried to create a ""flexible"" seating chart (meaning with a changeable number of columns and rows) in google sheets.

**This table represents my sheet:**

* I have a number given in cell C7, e.g. 3-n, that defines the number of tables
* I have a number given in cell C8, e.g. 2-n that defines the number of spots per table
* In row 10 and 11, the tables and #no are automatically generated (i.e. columns added or deleted and the text inserted respectively based on the number given in cell C7) → this works well
* After row 11, I want to have a certain number of rows → this doesn't work currently

**What I struggle with now:**

* In C8, the number of spots per table is given and it should correspond to the number of rows after row 11
* this means: if I set C8 = 5, I want to insert 3 rows between row 12 and 13, that I have in total 5 rows (12, 13, 14, 15, 16) → the last row should always be untouched
* if I then set C8 back to 2, I want to remove all ""additional"" rows, meaning the sheet should only contain the rows 12, 13, 14 (i hope this is somehow clear?)
* This should work for any given number between 2 and n
* So, I basically want to flexibly set a value in C8 that corresponds to the number of rows after row 11, while one additional row at the end should always be kept

My current script (see below) only adds the number of rows I specify in C8 (if i set it to 5, 5 rows are added, if I set C8 = 3 afterwards, 3 additional rows are added instead of 2 deleted). The script never deletes rows.. I already tried different things with the help of ChatGPT and Gemini, but nothing seemed to work and this version can at least add rows.

I hope someone can help me. Maybe someone can give me a hint on what to try/research as I'm really unexperienced with javascripting in google. I really would appreciate it. Thank you!

I would recommend you get rid of your two separate row/column functions, and instead make one buildSeatingChart(). It would fetch the current tables/seat per table values, and do everything needed.

That way you aren't relying on any part of the existing sheet being correct... you fix it all up every time.

You could also call then call buildSeatingChart() separately -- via button, menu option, or checkbox ""button"" -- to fix up the chart to match the current settings without having to artificially change those settings to trigger the script.

But...

Unless this is just a learning exercise, why are you doing all this in script at all?  

You could trivially build this with native sheets functions, which would instantly update and be easier to maintain.

If you separately wanted to trim the sheet to exact dimension (I am not clear why you need to do this) you could write a script that did only that -- i.e. trim it to getLastRow() and getLastColumn().

That script could be triggered by a checkbox, or if you didn't want to clutter up the sheet, with a custom menu item.

Now you don't have to hardcode all those range references into your script. If the script gets called, it just trims the active sheet. Easy peasy.

If you do this, I would have your Table-generating functions generate seat numbers or something so there's always data in those rows.  You could put that in a hidden column if you wanted to.

googlesheets,META question: how functions like IMPORTXML do what they do,"I'm bewildered by IMPORTXML-like functions.

One cell's worth of typing can result in the display of a huge array of data.

So, when I use IMPORTXML to scrape some data from a web page, and it results in the display of, for example, a 5x5 array of data… here's where my brain loses its grip…

If I double click the top-left cell, I'm presented with the IMPORTXML function.

If I double click on any cell next to it, I'm presented with its content. Of course sheets can't display the top left cells underlying code AND its displayed contents. The top left cell is special for IMPORTXML-types of functions. Okay, I can deal with that.

Here's the overall question: can I somehow modify the IMPORTXML function to, for example, print only the rightmost 5 characters for every cell imported using the IMPORTXML function?

Or do I have to first import the XML, and then in a separate area of my spreadsheet insert the function (ARRAYFORMULA?) to do the editing work I want to apply to all imported cells?

What I'm struggling with is ""can I have one IMPORTXML to do the import and then one \*function\* to do something to that imported array's contents using a single cell's function, just like the IMPORTXML was able to do in one cell, but which resulted in the display of an NxN array""?

I would suggest you do something like this to keep your sanity... let the labels do their labelling, then chop em off.  Sadly sheets doesn't have a great way chop the first row off an array afaik, but:

    =let(q, query(###BIG ASS QUERY###, 0),
    if(iserror(q),q,chooserows(q,sequence(rows(q)-1,1,2))))

The iserror() stuff at the end is to display errors as precisely as possible (if you feed an error into chooserows() the real error can get lost).

You could also do query(q, ""offset 1"", 0) but I was concerned about mixing data types (the label and the numbers) so the chooserows() felt safer.

\------

Idk why your error is just returning #N/A with no explanation.

I also don't know why it's failing, but I did get a clue when messing with it... if you specify the same summation twice you get a COLUMN\_ONLY\_ONCE error.

Based on that and the similarities of your summations I tried some shenanigans... the summation with an issue is by itself on the second line here:

    =let(q, query('90 As'!$T$3:$AD,""Select T,'90 As', count(U), sum(V), sum(W), sum(W)/sum(V), sum(Y), sum(X), sum(Z), (sum(W)+sum(Z))/(sum(V)+sum(Z)), sum(AA), sum(AA)/sum(V),
    1*sum(AA)/sum(V)+(1*sum(W)+sum(Z))/(1*sum(V)+sum(Z)), 
    sum(AB), sum(AC), sum(AD) where U<""&AE1&"" and T<> '' and not T contains 'Player' group by T Order by sum(V) desc"",0),
    if(iserror(q),q,chooserows(q,sequence(rows(q)-1,1,2))))

Adding the 1\* where I did fixes the problem. You can also put the 1\* on one of the earlier occurrences of a similar pattern.  Or reverse the order of the two sum() that you are adding together.

So... it seems to me to be some sort of bug where it thinks the same calculation is being done, or maybe it's trying (and failing) to cache a partial equation or... idk.

I didn't verify if the calculation is actually right, just that the error went away.

expDesc = store and desc columns, filtered to date and subcat

googlesheets,"Formula to sum numbers in a row, depending on whether column title meets additional criteria","As the title suggests, I'm looking for a formula that can sum various numbers in a row, depending on whether their column header meets a certain criteria, specific to each row. 

  
To explain:

* On sheet1: Column A contains a list of cities (from row 2 onwards)
* Row 1 contains various delivery companies (from column B onwards)
* The table then shows how many T-shirts were sent to each city last year, broken down by each individual delivery company. 
* Only some of the delivery companies will continue to service various city next year, so I want to find a way to sum the number of deliveries to each city last year, but only looking at the volumes from delivery companies that will continue to operate to that area next year. (in order to form a forecast)
* On sheet2: Column A contains the exact same list of cities from Sheet 1. 
* From Column B onwards, the delivery companies that will continue to service each city are listed across, with one company per cell. 

  
Is there a formula I can use that will only sum the values in cells of a row where the column header for a cell is part of the delivery company list on sheet 2 for the city listed in column A?

I have a Google Sheets document that I use to track income and expenses with. I have a tablesheet for each month, named as the corresponding month too. Fields where I don't have any expenses or income are left blank. Every cell is formated as ""currency"".

googlesheets,PTO Calendar issues help,"Hello! I followed a tutorial to make the PTO Tracker with no knowledge whatsoever of Google Sheets. I would appreciate help bringing two ideas to life:

1. The tutorial I followed provided a formula to make the dates entered we in the ‘Date’ column become automatically color blocked on the calendar itself. This was great, but you could only use it for 1 date at a time, which isn’t realistic for PTO.

I believe the formula was this:
=COUNTIF($Z$6:$Z$39,B7)>0

Does anyone know if this can be edited to allow a range of sequential dates to be entered and reflected in the calendar? 

2. If question 1 is answered, it would be amazing if there were a way for the drop down menu in the ‘Leave Type’ column to dictate the color of the dates that are filled in on the calendar, that way 
everything is automatically color coordinated.

Thank you for your help, and if you are able to answer, I kindly request that you explain it simply as this is my first time using Google Sheets.

Thank you!

I'm not exactly sure what you wanted in number 1, but at least i made the coloring in the calendar in accordance to ""Leave Type"" as described in your number 2. If i understood you correctly, this also takes care of your number 1?

I made 2 helper columns; AP and AQ for the date conversion. They are currently hidden. The conditional formatting rule references those helper columns.

In order to make the coloring match the drop down color, i just made a CF rule for every color (since every CF can only be of one color). It's not exactly the color of the drop downs that controls the coloring in the calendar, but the text. So if you change the color in your drop down, you will have to change to corresponding rule also, if you want them to keep matching. :)

I also had to change your input a little bit, since we need actual dates as both lower and upper bounds, so the 23/25 is too ambiguous (besides, we want just 1 date on each end). :)

googlesheets,Trying to average two sets of data into one chart?,"I am not sure even how to title this because I don't know if what I am asking is possible.

I have a spreadsheet that I use to keep all my book data together, like books read, when I read them, bought them, how many stars I gave them, etc. I have some charts I was able to manage on my own but there's an idea I have I've yet to figure out. I want to know the average rating I have for each genre. So I have a column naming the genre of each book, then a separete column with the rating of that book. Can I make a chart or something that averages all the ratings for all the fantasy books? I want to be able to average the ratings for all the genres I have listed. So I can look at my little color coded chart and go, ""okay on average I rate my fantasy books 3.85 stars"" or whatever. Someone once told me I'd need to use a pivot chart but before I go and learn how to make one, I want to know if what I am trying to do is even possible in google sheets, or at all.

googlesheets,Help getting a date range from weeks before or after a date. ,"*Edit: thank you for the help!!

Hello! I don’t have a lot of experience with spreadsheets but I’m trying to create an inventory of my garden seeds. I’m looking for a way to easily get a date range (ex: 4/1/25 - 4/14/25) based on how many weeks before a specific date. My seed packets say to plant the seeds 2-4 weeks before or after my average first frost date. I’d like to be able to enter “2-4 weeks before” or “2-4 weeks after” in column A so that column B automatically has the date range to plant. Forgive me for not knowing the Google Sheets lingo. The dates for planting are always a range of weeks before or after a date. 

So, let’s say my first frost date for this year is estimated to be 4/14/24 and the seed packet says plant 1-2 weeks before my first frost date.  How can I make Sheets take the number of weeks before or after that date and give me the date (in this case the date it would be giving me is 3/31 - 4/7)?

I tried to figure this out and the closest I got was using months difference (EMonth I think??) but couldn’t use half months. Is there a way to do this with weeks? Thank you internet strangers!

googlesheets,How to effectively share and maintain custom sheets for people?,"Hey guys, I have various sheets that I make and share with people, anything from tax calculators to sale logs to dashboards. Not everyone is using the same sheet. For example, for something containing tax information, my sheet is read-only and the user has to make a copy to their own Drive, and edit/access from there. Most of the sheets use Apps Script, and most of the actual sheet that the user is interacting with can be created from Apps Script (formatting/inserting formulas and values), if needed.

The problem is that I can’t fix or update a sheet that has been copied into another user’s drive where I don’t have access. In addition to that, I can’t expect every user to know if they have the newest version or not.

I have had some success using GAS’s deployment function when working with a script that used webhooks to receive data but that was only on one sheet- just different script deployments for that sheet, regarding the script it was using for the webhook and parse.

I have also heard of some similar functionality using Google’s gcloud CLI, but have never used it and don’t know if it would work with multiple users from different domains (aka users that I don’t have admin access to).

The issue I'm having, is Vecna should never go above the set HP limit, but I'm not versed enough with Sheets to figure out how to make the HP total stop at the limit.

Does anyone know how to achieve that in Sheets?""

googlesheets,How do I keep a cell with a formula from updating when I change the source data?,"So here's my issue. I'm creating a spreadsheet that will house titles of projects. The unique title will be composed of the calendar year, a consecutive number, and some short text describing the project (e.g. 2024\_5 Demo of Project). I want to have a field where a human can update which year it is, but I don't want it to update already created project titles. The formula then grabs the year from that cell. When we roll over to 2025, I don't want 2024\_5 Demo of Project to become 2025\_5 Demo of Project. I only want new entries to include the new year (e.g. 2025\_6 January Project). 

Possible wrinkle, I need the text fields to be updateable by a human. So if I wanted to change ""Demo of Project"" to ""Project Demo"" down the line, I do want the unique title to update to 2024\_5 Project Demo. 

  
I've tried T, TEXT, and INDIRECT, but the year keeps updating in the unique titles. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

You can hide Col A & B as helper columns. You will need to turn on iterative calculations, though.

Edit to add -- You can even hide Col C as well. Basically, you start typing in Col D whatever title you want. Col A is set up with an ""IF"" function so that once something is typed into Col D, it pops a ""NOW"" into that cell; but if something is already in Cell A, it shouldn't change. Col B pulls the year from Col A, then Col C concatenates it with the row number

Col E concatenates the whole thing into the human-readable title.

You could actually dispense with the Col C, and use the row number concat in current Col E....

googlesheets,How to sum from multiple ranges and criteria based on the placement of the sum ranges?,"So I have already asked for help for this gaming related sheet but I wanted to expand it more so here I am again.

This time it's related to the issue I mentioned in the title.

[Screenshot from the spreadsheet](https://preview.redd.it/goluld19t7ae1.png?width=1879&format=png&auto=webp&s=684fde2432f5018ed4e4cfbac4500371427d5e85)

So as you can see from the screenshot I have a lot of materials which are divided based on what they are used for in the game. The game calls them Badges so I'm gonna use that too. Every character has the same base badges but they use different materials based on the character (some characters have more badges based on if they have extra weapon types).

So I'd love if it's possible to sum the used materials based on if the materials match the material on the materials page.

[Screenshot of the materials page](https://preview.redd.it/dbscbr4su7ae1.png?width=1878&format=png&auto=webp&s=244af3bed29439d70df207c63a3f8291461c4af6)

On the right is a simple breakdown of the max materials a the character needs but these I got from GameFAQs, and instead of manually updating the amount of materials used (column Q) every time I make a new Badge I wonder if it could sum the materials used based on the name on the left half (like the bronze materials in column B) and then check if the Check box for the badge is marked true for having made it. I did the something similar but just taking the data from the right half as you can see with the Old Rag material sum formula.

So would this be possible and how? I know sumifs are a thing but I don't know if I can use multiple sum ranges.

To try to explain how I'd want it to work. The materials for the badges would be summed only when the check mark for that badge is true and the materials for the badge match the materials on the materials page. This would be the best way because some materials show up in multiple columns as well all named.

Side note: I haven't finished writing all the materials for the badges yet i'm like a quarter of the way through. I just wanted to know if it's even possible.

googlesheets,Offset Xlookup results with Arrayformula,"This is a bit complicated but I'll try my best to explain.

1.) I have 2 Sheets, the first sheet named ""Test"" is a database that shows the list of people, final rating, and self rating.

The second sheet named ""Department"" is essentially like a profile. Row 1 is filled with merged cells which contain the names of persons. 

Row 13 is filled with the rating values. There are multiple final and self rating columns which are under every person.

2.) I am using XLOOKUP to find the corresponding value of the person in their rating. (I.e. Potato in Row1, Potato's Final Rating in 13)

I managed to do this using an arrayformula as well.

3.) Now I want the Self Rating which is in another column. Since I am using merged cells, xlookup will automatically give me the leftmost column's result (Final rating), the Self-rating is 2 columns to the right.

I am trying to use offset to give me the value of the Self Rating which is 2 columns to the right of the Final Rating.

I managed to do it on an individual level but would like to use it in an arrayformula. Unfortunately, it keeps telling me ""argument needs to be a range""; or ""Could not find value X in XLOOKUP""; if I use IFERROR to just render blanks as blank, it does not populate the rest of the rows


My working formula is:
=OFFSET(XLOOKUP(A2, Department!$1:$1,Department!$13:$13), 0, 2)

So you can’t have two x-axis so you’ll need to re-organize the data into a table together so that the chart can interpret them correctly. 

One column will be your altitude, including all the values from both altitude columns you’ve shown. Column 2 is azimuth from 6/1 and column 3 is azimuth from 7/1. There will be blanks interspersed in the Azimuth columns whenever there isn’t a data point that matches a specific altitude. That’s ok! They just need to be together as three columns.

Then highlight all three, add your chart. The first column is your x axis and the second and third will be series.

In C44, try: `=COUNTA(FILTER($T2:$T43, C2:C43=""X""))/COUNTA(C2:C43)` and drag it across the row. This will produce a decimal, which you can use the Format menu to format as a percent.
